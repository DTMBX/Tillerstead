## 🎯 Design Principles

### The "Sparse & Purposeful" Approach

Each link must pass these tests:

1. **Does it directly answer a question?** (If no, remove it)
2. **Would readers benefit, or does it feel promotional?** (If promotional, remove it)
3. **Is the anchor text descriptive?** (If generic, rewrite it)
4. **Is this the only link to this post on this page?** (If duplicated, remove one)
5. **Are there fewer than 4 links total?** (If more, prioritize)

**Result**: 10-15 total internal links site-wide, strategically placed.

## 💡 Key Principles

**Demonstrate, Don't Tell**

- Don't say "we're TCNA-compliant"
- Instead: Link to content that proves TCNA knowledge

**Serve the Reader**

- Links should answer questions on the current page
- Not redirect for self-promotion

**Sparse > Abundant**

- 2-4 links per page is powerful
- 10+ links per page feels spammy

**Contextual Matters**

- A link mid-sentence is more natural than a "learn more" button
- Descriptive anchor text tells readers what they'll find

**Long-term Value**

- Blog becomes an authority hub
- Internal links compound search visibility
- Demonstrates expertise without being pushy
