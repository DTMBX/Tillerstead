# 1960s Bathroom Gut Renovation: Brigantine, NJ Before & After

**Project Location:** Brigantine, NJ (Atlantic County beach house)  
**Completion Date:** January 2026  
**Project Duration:** 18 days (20 if you count mold surprise)  
**Project Type:** Full gut renovation (emphasis on "gut")

---

## How It Started: The Panic Call

**The phone call (October 2025):**

**Sarah:** "We just bought a 1960s beach house in Brigantine, and the bathroom is... pink. Very pink."

**Me:** "Like, accent tile pink or—"

**Sarah:** "Floor, walls, toilet, everything. It's like Barbie's Dream House had a nightmare."

**Me:** "I can work with that."

**Sarah:** "Also, I think there's mold. The grout is... fuzzy."

**Me:** *(internally)* "Oh no."  
*(externally)* "Let me come take a look."

---

## What We Found (Spoiler: It Was Bad)

### The Aesthetic Crimes

When I walked in, I understood the urgency:

- ❌ **1964 original pink ceramic tile** (walls, floor, tub surround—*everywhere*)
- ❌ **Pink toilet** (matching, because of course)
- ❌ **Pink pedestal sink** (commitment to the theme)
- ❌ **Cast iron tub** (chipped, rusted, weighs 400 lbs)
- ❌ **Fluorescent box light** (the kind that buzzes and flickers)
- ❌ **Tiny medicine cabinet** (held exactly 3 items)
- ❌ **No exhaust fan** (just a window—in a shower)

### The Actual Problems (Discovered During Demo)

Day 1 of demo revealed the truth:

- ❌ **Black mold colony** behind entire shower wall (60 years of no waterproofing = biological experiment)
- ❌ **Three rotted studs** (structurally questionable)
- ❌ **Zero waterproofing** (1960s didn't believe in membranes)
- ❌ **Galvanized steel pipes** (corroded, leaking, obsolete)
- ❌ **No GFCI outlets** (code violation, safety hazard)
- ❌ **Floor sloped 1.5 inches** across 9 feet (beach house settling)

### Building Code Violations (The Legal Stuff)

- ❌ No waterproofing membrane (ANSI A118.10—[required per IRC R302.5.2](/nj-code-compliance/#waterproofing), non-existent in 1964)
- ❌ No GFCI outlets (NEC requirement—critical safety)
- ❌ Zero ventilation (80 CFM exhaust fan required per IRC R307.1, they had... a window)
- ❌ Non-compliant plumbing venting (1960s code ≠ 2026 code)

> **📋 Full Code Requirements:** See our [NJ Code Compliance Guide](/nj-code-compliance/) for complete IRC 2021 bathroom requirements including waterproofing, ventilation, and inspection schedules.

**Translation:** This bathroom wouldn't pass a single inspection if it was new construction. But it was 60 years old, grandfathered in, and slowly destroying itself from the inside.

## What Sarah and Tom Wanted

**The Non-Negotiables:**
1. **"Not pink"** (exact quote, repeated 4 times during consultation)
2. **Walk-in shower** (no tub—they're in their 50s, done with tub/shower combos)
3. **Double vanity** (they both get ready simultaneously, tired of sink wars)
4. **Heated floors** (Atlantic County winters = cold tile feet)
5. **Modern everything** (timeless, not trendy—resale matters)
6. **Storage** (pedestal sink held zero things)

**The Wish List:**
1. Rainfall showerhead + handheld wand
2. Built-in bench and niche (spa vibes)
3. Frameless glass enclosure (modern clean look)
4. Natural stone accents (a touch of luxury)

**Budget:** $35,000 (flexible for quality work)

---

## The Game Plan

### New Layout (Same 45 sq ft, Smarter Use)

**Before:**
- Tub/shower combo hogging left wall (wasted space)
- Toilet in center (only thing staying)
- Pedestal sink on right (tiny, useless)
- Corner space doing nothing

**After:**
- **36" x 60" walk-in shower** (left wall + back corner—spacious)
- **Toilet** (same spot—don't move plumbing unless necessary)
- **60" double vanity** (right wall—actual storage!)
- **Reclaimed 15 sq ft** from smarter layout

### What We're Installing

**Tile Choices:**
- **Floor:** 12x24 large format porcelain (gray, modern, fewer grout lines)
- **Shower walls:** 3x12 subway tile (white matte—timeless)
- **Shower floor:** 2x2 mosaic (gray textured—slip resistance)
- **Accent:** Marble mosaic niche border (the "money shot")

**Fixtures (Quality Stuff):**
- **Toto Aquia IV toilet** (dual-flush, comfort height—best in class)
- **Kohler Levity frameless glass door** (clean modern lines)
- **Delta Trinsic shower system** (matte black—current but not trendy)
- **Kohler 60" double vanity** (white shaker, classic)

**Finishes:**
- Matte black hardware (modern contrast)
- LED recessed lighting (6 cans—bright, energy efficient)
- Panasonic WhisperCeiling exhaust fan (110 CFM—quiet as hell)

**Budget Reality:** Came in at $23,445 (under budget). Sarah upgraded to premium vanity and frameless glass with savings.

## Timeline & The Drama

### Week 1: Demo & "Oh No" Moments (Days 1-5)

**Day 1 - Demo Day (The Mold Discovery)**

Started demo at 7 AM. By 9 AM, I was calling Sarah with bad news.

**What we found:** Black mold covering 80% of the shower wall cavity. Three studs soft enough to poke through with a screwdriver. 60 years of water damage concentrated behind pink tile.

**The call:**  
**Me:** "Sarah, we have a situation."  
**Sarah:** "How bad?"  
**Me:** "Mold. Lots of it. And structural damage."  
**Sarah:** *(silence)*  
**Me:** "But we can fix it. It'll add 2 days and about $1,450."  
**Sarah:** "Do what you have to do."

**Day 2 - Mold Remediation**

Set up containment (plastic sheeting everywhere), HEPA filtration, full hazmat mode. Treated all affected surfaces with antimicrobial solution. Removed contaminated wood. Air quality test before proceeding (passed).

**Day 3 - Framing Repairs**

Replaced 3 rotted studs, added blocking for future grab bars (aging-in-place prep), reinforced floor joists. Building inspector came out, approved rough-in.

**Day 4 - Plumbing**

Ripped out every galvanized pipe (corroded, leaking). Replaced with PEX (modern, reliable). Relocated shower valve to center. Moved toilet flange for better layout.

**Day 5 - Electrical**

Added dedicated 20A circuit (old panel was maxed out). Installed GFCI outlets everywhere (code requirement). Wired heated floor thermostat. Added 6 LED recessed cans. Mounted Panasonic exhaust fan (so quiet you forget it's running).

### Week 2-3: The Build (Days 6-16)

**Days 6-8 - Waterproofing (The Important Part)**

- Installed cement board walls with vapor barrier  
- Schluter Ditra-Heat on floor (heated tile = happy clients)  
- Schluter Kerdi membrane everywhere water touches  
- Pre-sloped shower pan (proper drainage)  
- **Day 9: 24-hour flood test** - Filled shower pan 2.5" deep, waited, no leaks. Building inspector approved. Photos documented everything.

**Days 10-15 - Tile Installation**

This is where it gets fun. Clean lines, perfect layout, no lippage.

- Subway tile walls (white matte, classic)
- Built-in niche with marble border (the photo moment)
- 2x2 mosaic shower floor (slip-resistant, proper slope)
- 12x24 floor tile over heated mat (warm feet in January)
- Light gray grout throughout (hides dirt, looks modern)

**Day 16 - Grouting & Sealing**

Laticrete PermaColor grout (premium, stain-resistant). Sealed all changes of plane with 100% silicone (code requirement, prevents leaks).

### Week 3: Finishing Touches (Days 17-18)

**Day 17 - Fixtures**

Installed vanity, countertop, toilet, frameless shower door, all hardware. Everything leveled, plumbed, perfect.

**Day 18 - Final Details**

Final grouting, caulking, deep cleaning. Walkthrough with Sarah and Tom.

**Their reaction:** Sarah cried (happy tears). Tom took 47 photos to send to family. They tipped the crew $300 and left a 5-star Google review that night.

## The Money Talk (Real Costs)

**Total Project:** $23,445  
**Original Budget:** $35,000  
**Savings:** $11,555 (which Sarah used to upgrade vanity and glass door)

### Cost Breakdown (The Truth)

| Category | Cost | Tyler's Notes |
|----------|------|---------------|
| **Tile & Materials** | $1,720 | Quality porcelain, not big-box junk |
| **Schluter Waterproofing** | $895 | Non-negotiable, saves $40K in future mold |
| **Toto Toilet** | $420 | Best flushing toilet made, period |
| **Delta Shower System** | $680 | Matte black, lifetime warranty |
| **Kohler Vanity + Top** | $1,850 | Client upgrade (worth it) |
| **Frameless Glass Door** | $1,200 | Clean modern look, no metal frame |
| **Heated Floor Mat** | $720 | 40 sq ft NuHeat system |
| **Lighting & Fan** | $600 | LED + quiet Panasonic fan |
| **Mold Remediation** | $1,080 | Surprise expense, unavoidable |
| **Plumbing (PEX repipe)** | $320 | Future-proof plumbing |
| **Labor (18 days)** | $12,900 | 60% of total cost (reality of tile work) |
| **Permits & Inspections** | $600 | Legal protection |
| **Dumpster & Misc** | $460 | Disposal, air quality testing |

**Materials:** $9,215  
**Labor:** $12,900 (58% labor, 42% materials—normal for quality tile work)  
**Permits/Other:** $1,330  

**ROI:** Estimated home value increase of $35K-45K on a $23K investment. That's 149-192% return.

## The Challenges (What Almost Went Wrong)

### Challenge #1: The Mold Colony

**The Problem:** Day 1 demo revealed black mold paradise behind shower walls. 60 years of zero waterproofing + Atlantic County humidity = biological science project.

**What I Did:**
1. Full containment with 6-mil plastic sheeting
2. HEPA filtration (professional grade, not Home Depot rental)
3. Antimicrobial treatment on all surfaces
4. Replaced 3 rotted studs (structural integrity)
5. Air quality testing before proceeding (passed on first try)

**Cost Impact:** +$1,450 (remediation + framing)  
**Lesson:** Always budget 10-15% contingency for pre-1980s homes. Hidden problems are the norm, not the exception.

### Challenge #2: Corroded Galvanized Pipes

**The Problem:** Original 1964 galvanized steel pipes were corroded, leaking, and would've failed within 2 years. Modern fixtures wouldn't work with old plumbing anyway.

**What I Did:**
- Complete repipe with PEX (modern, reliable, warrantied)
- Updated venting to 2026 code
- Relocated shower valve for better positioning
- **Cost:** +$320 materials, +1 day labor (included in estimate)

**Benefit:** Sarah and Tom now have 50+ years of leak-free plumbing. Water pressure improved 40%. Future repairs are easier (PEX is simple to work with).

### Challenge #3: Sloped Floor (Beach House Settling)

**The Problem:** Floor had 1.5" slope across 9 feet. Common in Brigantine beach houses built on sand. Large format tile requires flat substrate within 1/8" over 10 feet.

**What I Did:**
- Mapei Ultraplan self-leveling compound
- Raised low areas to match high point
- Verified with 6-foot level (perfect)
- **Cost:** +$280 (materials + labor, already in estimate)

**Result:** Flat substrate = perfect large-format tile installation. No lippage, no hollow tiles, no future cracks.

## Technical Highlights (The Nerdy Details)

### TCNA-Compliant Installation

**Waterproofing:**
- Schluter Kerdi membrane (ANSI A118.10 certified)
- Factory pre-formed corners (no field-cutting failure points)
- 24-hour flood test performed and passed
- 6" membrane above shower head (code requirement)

**Tile Work:**
- 95%+ thinset coverage on all large format (LFT standard)
- 1/4" per foot slope on shower floor (code minimum)
- Movement joints at all changes of plane (prevents cracks)
- Proper substrate prep (cement board + vapor barrier)

**Code Compliance:**
- NJ HIC permits obtained (#13VH10808800)
- 3 inspections: rough-in, waterproofing, final (100% pass rate)
- GFCI outlets on all receptacles
- 110 CFM exhaust fan (exceeds 80 CFM requirement)
- PEX plumbing per current IRC standards

### Future-Proofing (Aging-in-Place Features)

- Comfort-height toilet (17" vs. standard 15"—easier on knees)
- Grab bar blocking hidden in walls (ready when needed)
- Slip-resistant shower floor (R10 rating—safe when wet)
- Lever faucets (easier than knobs for arthritic hands)
- Curbless option discussed (they chose curb for aesthetics, but we're ready if they change minds)

### Energy Efficiency

- LED lighting throughout (90% less energy than old fluorescent)
- Low-flow toilet (1.28 gpf vs. old 3.5 gpf = 64% water savings)
- WaterSense showerhead (1.75 gpm = $200/year water bill reduction)
- Heated floor = zone heating (don't heat whole house for warm bathroom)

## Lessons Learned

**For Homeowners Planning a Remodel:**

1. **Budget for Surprises** - Pre-1980s homes hide problems. Plan 10-20% contingency. This project: mold/framing added $1,450.

2. **Waterproofing is Non-Negotiable** - ANSI A118.10 membrane costs $680. Fixing water damage later costs $15K-40K. Math is easy.

3. **Hire Licensed Contractors** - Permits protect you. Insurance won't cover unpermitted work. Inspections catch mistakes before tile goes up.

4. **Material Quality Pays Off** - Premium Toto toilet lasts 30 years. Budget toilet fails in 8. Long-term value beats upfront savings.

**For Fellow Contractors:**

1. **Invasive Inspection Before Quoting** - Could've discovered mold with exploratory demo. Would've quoted accurately from start.

2. **Document Everything** - Photos of mold, rotted studs, corroded pipes protected against scope creep accusations. Building department loved documentation.

3. **Over-Communicate Timeline Changes** - Mold added 2 days. Called Sarah immediately, explained why, gave new timeline. She appreciated transparency.
