# Curbless Shower Conversion: When Mom Needs to Stay Home

**Project Location:** Somers Point, NJ (Single-story ranch)  
**Completion Date:** February 2026  
**Project Duration:** 12 days  
**Project Type:** Curbless shower conversion (aging-in-place accessibility)

---

## The Phone Call That Matters

**Patricia's voice was shaky when she called:**

"My mom had hip surgery six weeks ago. She's 78. She's doing okay, but she can't step over the shower curb anymore. She fell last Tuesday trying to get out. Didn't break anything, thank God, but she's terrified now."

*(Pause)*

"The assisted living place has an opening. Mom doesn't want to go. She loves her house. She's lived there 40 years. But I can't let her shower if it's not safe."

**Me:** "What if we could make her shower safe? Curbless entry, grab bars, bench—the whole setup?"

**Patricia:** "Is that possible? How much time? How much money?"

**Me:** "Twelve days, about $16K. Her insurance might cover part of it as medical necessity."

**Patricia:** *(crying)* "Can you start Monday?"

---

## What We Were Fixing

### The Dangerous Reality (Before)

Patricia's mom's bathroom was textbook 1990s builder-grade:

- ❌ **6-inch shower curb** (trip hazard—already caused one fall)
- ❌ **Zero grab bars** (nothing to hold onto)
- ❌ **Slippery 12x12 tile** (glossy, minimal texture)
- ❌ **Fixed showerhead only** (can't shower seated)
- ❌ **Narrow 32-inch door** (tight for walker, impossible for wheelchair)
- ❌ **No seating** (standing shower only)

### What the Family Needed

**Non-Negotiables:**
1. **Zero-threshold entry** (Mom uses a walker—can't lift feet high)
2. **Wheelchair accessible** (future-proofing for potential mobility decline)
3. **Grab bars everywhere** (entry, bench, controls)
4. **Built-in bench** (safe transfer surface, seated bathing)
5. **Handheld shower** (reach everything from seated position)

**The Emotional Need:**
Patricia's mom didn't want "institutional" looking. She wanted safe AND dignified. Not a hospital shower, a beautiful accessible shower.

**Budget:** $18,000 (insurance covered $5K as medical necessity)  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks max (Mom staying with Patricia during work)

## The Accessibility Game Plan

### Curbless Conversion Challenge

**Here's the problem with curbless showers in existing homes:**

Traditional showers have a raised pan (sits on the floor). Curbless showers need the drain BELOW the floor level (so water slopes away).

> **🏗️ Technical Standard:** Curbless showers require precise slope engineering per TCNA Method B421 (mortar bed with linear drain) and ANSI A108.10 (bonded waterproof membrane). See our [TCNA Methods Guide](/tcna-methods/#installation-methods) for complete specifications.

**Patricia's mom's house:**
- Floor joists: 8 inches tall (discovered during demo)
- Curbless drain needs: 3-4 inches depth
- **Solution:** Lower the shower floor area, transition smoothly to bathroom floor

**Why Not Raise the Whole Bathroom Floor?**

Could've raised the entire bathroom 3-4 inches instead. But that means:
- New toilet flange (expensive)
- Door trim modifications (complicated)
- Vanity height issues (awkward)
- Cost: $4,200 vs. $2,800 to lower just the shower

We lowered the shower floor. Smarter, cheaper, less disruptive.

### What We're Installing (The Safe + Beautiful Combo)

**Accessibility Features:**
- **Curbless entry** (0" threshold—roll/walk straight in)
- **60" x 30" shower** (wheelchair turning radius)
- **Fold-down bench** (Moen Home Care, 250 lb weight rating)
- **3 grab bars** (entry, bench, controls—ADA compliant)
- **Handheld shower + rain head** (versatile bathing)
- **Linear drain** (no center drain to step on)

**Safety Elements:**
- **R11 slip-resistant tile** (textured, safe when wet)
- **High-contrast grout** (visual aid to see slope)
- **Enhanced LED lighting** (5000K daylight spectrum—see clearly)
- **Thermostatic valve** (anti-scald protection—critical for elderly)

> **♿ ADA Compliance Note:** This shower meets ADA 2010 Standards (Section 608) for residential accessibility: 60"x30" minimum clear space, grab bars at 33"-36" height, controls 38"-48" AFF (above finished floor), slip-resistant surface (DCOF ≥0.42). For NJ building code requirements, see our [NJ Code Compliance Guide](/nj-code-compliance/).

**Materials (Quality Stuff That Lasts):**
- **Tile:** 12x24 porcelain floor (gray matte), 3x12 subway walls (white)
- **Schluter Kerdi-Line:** 48" brushed stainless linear drain ([TCNA Method B415](/tcna-methods/#waterproofing))
- **Schluter Kerdi-Board:** Waterproof substrate (bench + walls, ANSI A118.10 compliant)
- **Kohler thermostatic valve:** Temperature control, safety lockout
- **Brushed nickel finishes:** Easier to grip when wet than chrome

## The Build (12 Days to Independence)

### Week 1: Structure & Safety (Days 1-6)

**Day 1 - Demo & Discovery**

Removed fiberglass pan, tile, everything. Exposed floor joists.

**Surprise:** Joists were only 8" tall (expected 10"). Meant deeper cuts, more structural work. Called Patricia, explained, adjusted timeline by half a day. She approved.

**Day 2 - Structural Work**

Cut and lowered 3 floor joists in shower area. Installed 2x10 headers for support. Reinforced adjacent joists. Building inspector came out, signed off on rough-in.

**Day 3 - Plumbing**

Relocated drain to front of shower (linear drain location). Installed Schluter Kerdi-Line drain base. Moved shower valve to 38" height (wheelchair reach range). Added dedicated vent line.

**Day 4 - Grab Bar Blocking (Critical for Safety)**

Installed 2x8 blocking for all grab bar locations:
- Entry grab bar (horizontal, 33-36" height)
- Bench grab bars (L-shape, vertical + horizontal)
- Control wall grab bar (vertical, near valve)

Also added blocking for fold-down bench (needs 16" on-center studs for weight support).

**Days 5-6 - Waterproofing**

Schluter Kerdi-Board on walls (no cement board needed—it's waterproof substrate). Built integrated bench structure with Kerdi-Board-SN. Applied Kerdi membrane on all seams. Pre-formed corners (Kerdi-Kereck—no cutting).

### Week 2: The Final Touches (Days 7-12)

**Days 7-8 - Floor Slope & Transition**

Built mortar slope (1/4" per foot to linear drain). Created gradual transition to bathroom floor (less than 1/2" change per ADA). Installed Schluter Ditra on transition area (uncoupling membrane—prevents cracks).

**Day 9 - Flood Test**

Filled shower with 2" of water. Waited 24 hours. **Zero leaks.** Critical for curbless—water can go anywhere if waterproofing fails. Building inspector approved. Photos documented.

**Days 10-11 - Tile Installation**

12x24 porcelain floor with minimal grout lines. Same tile blends into bathroom floor (seamless transition). Subway tile walls. Marble accent band at shoulder height (decorative + helps Mom see where shower area is). Slip-resistant mosaic on bench top.

**Day 12 - Fixtures & Completion**

Installed linear drain grate. Mounted fold-down bench (tested—holds 250+ lbs easily). Installed all 3 grab bars (tested each one by hanging my full weight). Shower valve, handheld + slide bar, rain head, partial glass panel (24" for splash control). Grouted, sealed, cleaned.

**4 PM on Day 12:** Patricia brought her mom to see it.

---

## Mom's Reaction (Why I Do This Work)

Patricia's mom walked in with her walker. Looked at the shower. Looked at Patricia. Started crying.

**"I can stay in my house?"**

**Patricia:** "Yes, Mom. This is yours."

Her mom walked right into the shower (zero curb—she didn't have to lift her feet). Sat on the bench. Grabbed the grab bars. Smiled.

**"It's beautiful. It doesn't look like a hospital."**

That's the goal. Safe doesn't have to look institutional. Accessible can be elegant.

## The Money Talk

**Total Cost:** $15,880  
**Insurance Covered:** $5,000 (medical necessity—hip surgery recovery)  
**Out of Pocket:** $10,880

### Cost Breakdown

| Category | Cost | Why It Matters |
|----------|------|----------------|
| **Tile & Materials** | $1,760 | Slip-resistant, durable, looks great |
| **Schluter Waterproofing** | $1,820 | Curbless = water everywhere, must be perfect |
| **Fold-Down Bench** | $420 | Weight-rated, ADA-compliant, safe transfer |
| **Grab Bars (3x)** | $380 | 300 lb rated, properly blocked, life-saving |
| **Thermostatic Valve** | $680 | Anti-scald protection (critical for elderly) |
| **Linear Drain** | $380 | No center drain to step on, modern look |
| **Handheld + Rain Shower** | $460 | Versatile bathing (seated or standing) |
| **Structural Work** | $240 | Lowering floor joists, proper support |
| **Plumbing** | $420 | Drain relocation, valve repositioning |
| **Labor (12 days)** | $9,000 | 57% of total (normal for this work) |
| **Permits & Inspections** | $400 | Legal protection, code compliance |
| **Dumpster** | $320 | Disposal |

**Materials:** $6,160  
**Labor:** $9,000  
**Permits/Other:** $720  

**ROI:** Priceless. Mom gets to stay home. Patricia has peace of mind. That's worth way more than $15K.

## Curbless Reality Check (Costs & Challenges)

### Why Curbless Costs More Than Traditional

**Traditional shower:** $8,000-12,000  
**Curbless shower:** $14,000-20,000

**Why the difference?**

1. **Structural work** ($1,600-2,800) - Lowering floor joists or raising bathroom floor
2. **Linear drain** ($380-600) - More expensive than center drain
3. **Precise slope** ($700-1,200 labor) - 1/4" per foot, perfectly executed
4. **Enhanced waterproofing** ($400-800) - No curb = water containment is critical
5. **Accessibility fixtures** ($800-1,500) - Grab bars, bench, proper blocking

**Is it worth it?**

If the alternative is assisted living ($4,000-8,000/month), a $15K one-time investment that lets Mom stay home for 5-10 more years? Absolutely worth it.

### Common Curbless Challenges

**"Will water flood my bathroom?"**

Not if it's done right. Proper slope + linear drain + partial glass panel = water stays in shower. I've never had a curbless shower flood with correct installation.

**"Does it look institutional?"**

Only if you use institutional materials. Gray porcelain, white subway, marble accents, brushed nickel—looks like a spa, not a hospital.

**"Can it work in my house?"**

If you have:
- At least 8" floor joists (most homes do)
- Single-story or first-floor bathroom (easier than second floor)
- Budget of $14K-20K

Then yes, it's possible. I've done 12 curbless conversions in Atlantic County in the past 2 years.

## Patricia & Her Mom's Feedback

> "Tyler gave my mother her independence back. She showers confidently now. She uses the bench, the grab bars, the handheld shower—everything works perfectly. The shower is beautiful (not institutional-looking at all), and I have complete peace of mind knowing she's safe. Worth every penny. My mom cried happy tears when she first saw it. So did I."  
> — Patricia, Somers Point, NJ

**Update (6 weeks later):** Patricia called to say her mom showers independently now. No help needed. Uses the bench, takes her time, feels safe. That's the win.

## Universal Design = Good Design

Here's what I learned from 15+ years doing accessibility work:

**Curbless showers aren't a compromise.** They're better design for everyone:

- **Parents with young kids:** No lifting toddlers over curbs
- **Anyone with luggage/laundry:** Walk right in with baskets
- **Cleaning:** Mop/squeegee straight from shower to bathroom
- **Resale:** Broader buyer appeal (aging population wants accessibility)
- **Future-proofing:** You'll age too. Build it right now.

The design elements that help a 78-year-old with a walker also help:
- A 45-year-old with a sprained ankle
- A 30-year-old carrying a baby
- A 25-year-old who's just tired and wants to sit while showering

**Good accessible design is just... good design.**

## Technical Highlights (The Nerdy Stuff)

### ADA Compliance (What Actually Matters)

**Shower Size:** 60" x 30" minimum (wheelchair turning radius)  
**Threshold:** 0" (truly level, no beveled edge tricks)  
**Grab Bars:** 1.25" diameter, 1.5" clearance from wall, 250+ lb rated  
**Bench:** 17-19" height, 250 lb capacity, L-shaped grab bar adjacent  
**Controls:** 38-48" height (wheelchair reach range)  
**Slope:** 1/4" per foot maximum (drainage without trip hazard)

### Waterproofing (Why Schluter for Curbless)

Curbless showers are waterproofing's final exam. Water can migrate anywhere.

**Why Schluter:**
- Integrated system (base + drain + membrane = one warranty)
- Pre-sloped base (slope built in, no mortar bed errors)
- Linear drain bonding flange (waterproof connection)
- Kerdi-Board bench (structural + waterproof in one)

**Flood test:** 2" water, 24 hours, zero leaks. Passed on first try.
