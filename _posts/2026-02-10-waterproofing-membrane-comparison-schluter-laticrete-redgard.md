# Waterproofing Membrane Comparison: Schluter Kerdi vs Laticrete Hydroban vs RedGard

**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026 | **Reading Time:** 10 minutes

Look, I've installed over 200 tile showers in the last 15 years, and I'm going to tell you something that might surprise you: **The membrane matters more than the tile.**

Seriously. You can put $20/sq ft marble over a bad membrane and it'll leak. Or you can put $3/sq ft ceramic over a proper membrane and it'll be bone-dry for 30 years.

Choosing the right waterproofing membrane is like choosing a foundation for your house—nobody sees it, but mess it up and the whole thing crumbles. I've personally torn out $40,000 showers that failed because someone skimped on a $400 membrane.

This is my completely unfiltered comparison of the three waterproofing systems I actually use: **Schluter Kerdi**, **Laticrete Hydroban**, and **Custom RedGard**. I'm not getting paid by any of them (though Schluter, if you're reading this, I accept bribes in pre-formed corners).

## Why This Comparison Matters (And Why Your Contractor Might Be Lying)

Some contractors will tell you "all membranes are the same." Those contractors either don't know what they're doing, or they're using whatever's cheapest and hoping you don't notice.

Here's the truth: Not all ANSI A118.10 membranes are created equal. They all meet the minimum standard (that's what A118.10 means), but installation difficulty, cost, durability, and warranty vary **wildly**.

I've seen contractors:
- Use liquid RedGard on a curbless shower (rookie move—sheet membrane required)
- Try to mix Schluter components with Laticrete drains (voided both warranties)
- Skip pre-formed corners to save $30 (cost the homeowner $8,000 in repairs)

Don't be that homeowner.

## Why Waterproofing Matters (And What Happens When It Fails) {#why-waterproofing-matters}

**Water doesn't need much to destroy your home.** A gap the width of a human hair can let thousands of gallons seep into your walls over a few years.

### War Story: The Brigantine Disaster

**Brigantine, NJ - Summer 2025**

Got a call from a panicked homeowner. "Tyler, there's a weird smell in the bathroom and the ceiling below is stained."

I already knew what I'd find.

Pulled off one tile (it practically fell off on its own). The cement board behind it was black. Not gray. Not spotted. **Black.** Like someone painted it with mold.

Turns out the previous "contractor" (let's call him Larry the Liability) used "water-resistant" backer board with **no membrane**. Larry told them, "This board is waterproof—it says so right on it!"

**The Results:**
- 3 years of showers = water seeping through grout
- Black mold covering 90% of shower walls
- Mold spores in HVAC ducts (kid had asthma symptoms for months)
- Total damage: **$38,000** (tear-out, mold remediation, rebuild)
- Insurance claim: **DENIED** (improper installation)

Larry? Disappeared. Phone disconnected. Business name changed. Classic.

**What Larry Got Wrong:**
- Skipped ANSI A118.10 waterproofing membrane (required per [IRC R302.5.2](/nj-code-compliance/#waterproofing))
- No understanding of TCNA installation methods (see our [TCNA Methods Guide](/tcna-methods/) for proper standards)

> **🏗️ Code Requirement:** NJ IRC R302.5.2 mandates ANSI A118.10 waterproofing in all shower installations. For full inspector checklist, see [NJ Code Compliance Guide](/nj-code-compliance/#inspection-schedule).

**What a Proper Installation Requires:**
❌ "Water-resistant" board ≠ waterproof (huge difference)  
❌ No ANSI A118.10 membrane (required by NJ code since 2015)  
❌ No flood test (would've caught it immediately)  
❌ Field-cut corners (proper corners are pre-formed)

That $400 membrane Larry skipped to save money? Cost the homeowner **$38,000**.

Don't hire Larry.

### What Waterproofing Actually Does

Let me explain this because too many people get it wrong:

**Tile is NOT waterproof.** Neither is grout. Both are porous—water goes right through them.

The waterproofing membrane **behind** the tile is what keeps water from reaching your studs, insulation, and drywall.

Think of it like a raincoat. The tile is your outer jacket (looks nice, provides some protection). The membrane is the waterproof layer underneath (does the actual work).

**Building Code Reality (New Jersey):**
- ANSI A118.10 compliant membrane = **MANDATORY** since 2015
- Inspectors actually check for this
- No membrane = failed inspection = project stops = you pay for re-work

> **Critical Fact That'll Save You $40K:** Tile and grout are NOT waterproofing. They're decorative surfaces over a waterproof membrane. If your contractor says "we don't need a membrane because we're using premium grout," run. Fast.

## ANSI A118.10: The Magic Number You Need to Know {#ansi-compliance}

### What Is ANSI A118.10? (And Why Should You Care?)

**ANSI** = American National Standards Institute  
**A118.10** = "Specification for Load Bearing, Bonded, Waterproof Membranes for Thin-Set Ceramic Tile and Dimension Stone Installation"

**In Plain English:** It's the industry standard that separates real waterproofing from wishful thinking.

When a product is "ANSI A118.10 compliant," it means it passed rigorous testing to prove it can actually keep water out. When it's not... well, you're basically trusting magic and hope.

### What Makes A118.10 Special?

**Performance Requirements** (aka "The Gauntlet"):
- **Hydrostatic pressure:** Must withstand 330 feet of water pressure (14.3 PSI) - that's like having a 30-story building of water pushing on it
- **Crack bridging:** Must stay waterproof even when substrate cracks up to 1/8" (because concrete cracks, always)
- **Temperature range:** -20°F to 180°F without failure (NJ winters + hot showers)
- **UV exposure:** 30+ days in direct sunlight without degrading
- **Mold resistance:** Must not support mold growth (critical in humid NJ)

**Testing Protocol** (No Shortcuts):
- 28-day water immersion test (not 24 hours—28 DAYS)
- 10+ freeze/thaw cycles minimum
- Crack isolation testing (simulates structural movement)
- Bond strength verification (won't delaminate)

Manufacturers can't just claim compliance—they have to prove it with independent lab testing. That's why A118.10 matters.

### The Confusion: "Water-Resistant" vs. Waterproof

This is where homeowners get scammed. Let me settle this once and for all:

| Feature | ANSI A118.10 Membrane | "Water-Resistant" Board |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Actually waterproof | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (moisture resistant only) |
| NJ code compliant | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (for wet areas) |
| Can bridge cracks | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Requires flood test | ✅ Yes | ❌ N/A |
| Manufacturer warranty | ✅ 10-50 years | ❌ Varies (usually none) |

**Here's the scam:** "Water-resistant" cement board (HardieBacker, Durock, etc.) is NOT waterproofing. It's the substrate you install waterproofing **on top of**.

Saying cement board is waterproofing is like saying drywall is insulation. It's not—it's what you put insulation behind.

> **Translation Guide:**
> 
> **What they say:** "We use waterproof cement board—you don't need a membrane"  
> **What they mean:** "I'm cutting corners and hoping you don't know better"  
> **What you should do:** Run. Fast.

**Bottom Line:** You need cement board AND membrane. Board is the substrate. Membrane is the waterproofing. Both required by code.

## The Big Three: Schluter vs. Laticrete vs. RedGard {#systems-overview}

After installing over 200 showers with these systems, here's my brutally honest take on each.

### Market Reality (2026)

**1. Schluter Kerdi** - ~40% market share
- Premium German engineering
- Most comprehensive system (everything integrates)
- Highest price, highest quality
- **My take:** The Mercedes of waterproofing

**2. Laticrete Hydroban** - ~35% market share  
- Sheet AND liquid options (versatility)
- Professional contractor favorite
- Mid-range pricing, excellent performance
- **My take:** The Honda of waterproofing (reliable, proven)

**3. Custom RedGard** - ~25% market share
- Liquid-applied focus
- DIY-friendly (available at big box stores)
- Budget-friendly pricing
- **My take:** The Toyota of waterproofing (economical, gets the job done)

All three are ANSI A118.10 compliant—they meet the minimum standard. The differences are in **installation difficulty**, **cost**, **component ecosystem**, and **long-term performance**.

None of them are "bad." But they're different, and which one you choose depends on your project, budget, and who's installing it.

## Schluter Kerdi: The German Engineering Approach {#schluter-kerdi}

**TCNA Method:** B415-18 (Bonded waterproof membrane over cement board or Kerdi-Board)  
**ANSI Standard:** A118.10 compliant (independently tested and verified)

> **📋 Technical Details:** For complete TCNA Method B415 specifications and installation requirements, see our [TCNA Methods Guide - Waterproofing](/tcna-methods/#waterproofing).

### My Honest Opinion

I use Schluter on 70% of my jobs. It's more expensive, but it's the most **foolproof** system I've ever used.

Why? Because Schluter thought of everything. Every corner, every transition, every edge case has a pre-engineered solution. You're not field-fabricating anything—you're assembling German-engineered components that fit together perfectly.

Is it overkill for a basic tub/shower combo? Maybe. But I sleep better at night knowing that shower won't leak.

### System Components (The Ecosystem)

### System Components (The Ecosystem)

**1. Kerdi Membrane** - The orange fleece
- Rolls: 54", 98", 200" widths (covers most shower sizes in one piece)
- Color: Bright orange (inspector can see it from across the room)
- Thickness: 8 mil polyethylene core + fleece bonding layers
- Overlaps: 2" minimum, 2.5" recommended (I always do 2.5")

**2. Pre-Formed Corners** - No field-cutting allowed
- Kerdi-Kereck-F (inside corners) - Factory-sealed, guaranteed waterproof
- Kerdi-Kereck (outside corners) - Same deal
- Kerdi-Band (seams, transitions) - For areas that need extra coverage

**3. Shower Pan System** - The genius part
- Kerdi-Shower-Kit: Pre-sloped foam base (no mortar bed needed!)
- Includes center drain, curb, bonding flange
- Available in multiple sizes (32x60", 48x48", etc.)
- **My take:** This alone saves 4-6 hours of labor

**4. Drains** - Integrates perfectly
- Kerdi-Drain (ABS or PVC versions)
- Includes bonding flange that bonds directly to Kerdi membrane
- Clamping ring ensures waterproof seal
- **Pro tip:** The drain IS the waterproofing at the drain—no separate liner needed

**5. Specialized Components** (This is where Schluter shines)
- Kerdi-Board: Foam substrate (replaces cement board)
- Kerdi-Fix: Sealant for joints
- Kerdi-Seal-PS/-MV: Mixing valve and pipe seals
- Schluter-Bench: Pre-fabricated shower bench
- Schluter-Shelf: Recessed niche system

### Pros (Why I Use It)

✅ **Complete Ecosystem** - Every component designed to work together, no mixing brands  
✅ **Pre-Sloped Pans** - Saves hours of mortar work, guaranteed slope  
✅ **Orange Color** - Inspector can verify coverage instantly  
✅ **Foolproof Installation** - Hard to mess up if you follow instructions  
✅ **Excellent Warranty** - Schluter backs their system (10-year minimum, often longer)  
✅ **Technical Support** - Their customer service actually helps  
✅ **Curbless-Friendly** - Best system for zero-threshold showers

### Cons (The Reality Check)

❌ **Price** - 30-50% more expensive than alternatives  
❌ **Thinset Sensitivity** - Requires unmodified thinset (can't use what you have on hand)  
❌ **Component Lock-In** - Once you commit to Schluter, you're buying all Schluter  
❌ **Availability** - Not at every supplier, sometimes need to order ahead  
❌ **Overkill for Simple Jobs** - A basic tub/shower doesn't need this level of engineering

### Real-World Cost (2026 Atlantic County Project)

**60" x 36" Shower (Standard Size):**
- Kerdi membrane (roll): $180
- Kerdi-Shower-Kit (pan + curb): $420
- Kerdi-Drain: $180
- Pre-formed corners (x4): $40
- Kerdi-Fix sealant: $25
- **Total Material Cost: ~$845**

**For Comparison:**
- Traditional mortar bed system: $200-300 in materials
- **Premium you're paying: $545-645**

**But here's the thing:** That premium buys you 6 hours of labor savings (no mortar bed) + peace of mind. On a $15,000 shower project, $600 is 4% of total cost for significantly reduced risk.

Is it worth it? For my reputation and my client's home? Yes. Every time.

## Laticrete Hydroban: The Professional's Choice {#laticrete-hydroban}

### My Honest Take

Laticrete Hydroban is what I recommend when clients want professional-grade waterproofing without the Schluter price tag. It's the Honda Accord of shower systems—reliable, proven, and nobody ever regretted buying one.

I've used Hydroban on 60+ showers. Never had a callback. Never had a leak. It just works.

### System Options (Versatility is Key)

**Option 1: Hydroban Board** (Sheet Membrane)
- Blue foam board with integrated waterproofing
- Works like Schluter Kerdi-Board
- Install, seal joints, tile—done
- **My take:** Fastest installation, great for tight schedules

**Option 2: Hydroban Liquid** (Paint-On)
- Trowel or roll-on application
- Two coats minimum
- Great for details and hard-to-reach areas
- **My take:** Perfect for renovations with weird geometry

**Option 3: Hydroban Sheet Membrane**
- Similar to Schluter Kerdi (fleece-backed)
- Thinset-bonded
- **My take:** If you like Schluter's approach but want to save money

### Why Contractors Love Hydroban

✅ **Flexibility** - Sheet, liquid, or board—choose what fits the job  
✅ **Mix-and-Match** - Can use Hydroban liquid for details + board for walls  
✅ **Wide Availability** - Most tile suppliers stock it  
✅ **Proven Track Record** - Been around since the '90s  
✅ **Competitive Pricing** - 20-30% less than Schluter  
✅ **Modified Thinset Compatible** - Can use standard thinset (saves money)

### Cons (Keeping It Real)

❌ **Less Hand-Holding** - No pre-sloped pans (you're building mortar bed)  
❌ **Component Ecosystem Smaller** - Fewer specialized parts  
❌ **Liquid Version Requires Skill** - Easy to miss spots, needs experience  
❌ **Color** - Board is blue, membrane is white (harder for inspectors to verify)

### Real-World Cost (Same 60" x 36" Shower)

**Using Hydroban Board System:**
- Hydroban Board (panels): $280
- Hydroban tape/sealant: $45
- Standard drain (non-proprietary): $120
- Corners/transitions: $30
- **Total Material Cost: ~$475**

**Savings vs. Schluter:** $370 (44% less)

**Labor Reality:** You're building a mortar bed pan (+4 hours labor), but saving on materials.

**My recommendation:** If you're hiring a pro, Hydroban is excellent value. If you're DIY, the Schluter pre-sloped pan might be worth the premium.

## Custom RedGard: The Budget-Friendly Option {#custom-redgard}

### Straight Talk

RedGard is the most recognizable waterproofing product in America because it's bright red, available at every Home Depot, and DIYers love it.

Is it good? Yes—it's ANSI A118.10 compliant.  
Is it professional-grade? Depends on how you use it.

I use RedGard liquid for small repairs and detail work. I don't use it as my primary system for full showers anymore (used to, upgraded to Hydroban/Schluter).

### The RedGard Ecosystem

**RedGard Liquid** (The Original)
- Bright red waterproofing membrane
- Roll or trowel application
- 2-3 coats required
- Dries in 1-2 hours per coat
- **Cost:** $40-60/gallon (covers ~50 sq ft per coat)

**RedGard Board**
- Orange foam board (like competitors)
- Good for DIYers who want sheet membrane
- **Cost:** ~$25-30 per 3'x5' panel

### Pros (Why It's Popular)

✅ **Price** - Cheapest ANSI A118.10 option  
✅ **Availability** - Every big box store, easy to find  
✅ **DIY-Friendly** - Instructions are simple  
✅ **Proven** - Been around since early 2000s  
✅ **Versatile** - Liquid works on any substrate  
✅ **Visible** - Bright red = you can see what you covered

### Cons (The Professional Perspective)

❌ **Labor-Intensive** - Multiple coats, dry time between each  
❌ **Skill-Dependent** - Easy to miss spots, uneven coverage  
❌ **Not a System** - No integrated drain solutions, fewer components  
❌ **Warranty Limitations** - Good, but not as comprehensive as Schluter  
❌ **Color** - Red shows through light-colored tile (use white thinset)

### When I Use RedGard

**Good Applications:**
- Tub/shower repairs (small areas)
- Detail work around pipes, valves
- DIY homeowner projects (with supervision)
- Budget-conscious renovations

**Not Recommended For:**
- High-end custom showers (use Schluter)
- Commercial projects (use Hydroban)
- Curbless showers (use sheet membrane systems)

### Real-World Cost (Same 60" x 36" Shower)

**Using RedGard Liquid:**
- RedGard liquid (3 gallons): $150
- Fabric membrane for corners: $40
- Standard drain: $120
- Mortar bed pan materials: $80
- **Total Material Cost: ~$390**

**Savings vs. Schluter:** $455 (54% less)  
**Savings vs. Hydroban:** $85 (18% less)

**The Catch:** Labor goes UP. Multiple coats + dry time = +6-8 hours. On a professional install, labor cost eats the material savings.

**My verdict:** For DIYers on a budget, RedGard works. For professionals, Hydroban offers better value when you factor in labor.
