## Why New Jersey Building Codes Matter {#why-codes-matter}

New Jersey has some of the strictest building codes in the nation—and for good reason. The state's high population density, coastal location, and varied climate create unique challenges for construction.

### What Happens Without Proper Code Compliance?

**Failed Inspections:**
- Project stops until violations are corrected
- Additional inspection fees ($150-300 per re-inspection)
- Delays of 2-4 weeks or more

**Insurance Issues:**
- Homeowner's insurance may deny water damage claims
- Difficulty selling your home (must disclose unpermitted work)
- Reduced home value

**Legal Consequences:**
- Fines up to $2,000 per day for unpermitted work
- Contractors face license suspension or revocation
- Homeowners liable for contractor violations

**Safety Risks:**
- Structural damage from water infiltration
- Mold growth behind walls
- Electrical hazards from water contact

> **Real Case:** A 2024 Atlantic County homeowner faced $43,000 in mold remediation costs after an unlicensed contractor installed a shower without waterproofing membranes. The insurance claim was denied because work wasn't permitted.

## NJ HIC Licensing Requirements {#hic-licensing}

### What is an HIC License?

**HIC** = **Home Improvement Contractor** license, issued by the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs.

**Key Requirements:**
- $500,000 general liability insurance
- $20,000 surety bond
- Proof of Workers' Compensation (if employees)
- Clean criminal background check
- Registration fee: $200/year

### Verify Your Contractor's License

**Always check:**
1. Visit [NJ Consumer Affairs Verify](https://newjersey.mylicense.com/verification/)
2. Enter contractor name or license number
3. Verify:
   - License is ACTIVE (not suspended)
   - Insurance is current
   - No disciplinary actions

**Red Flags:**
- "License is being processed" (illegal to work without active license)
- Refuses to provide license number
- Offers "discount for cash" (tax evasion)

**Our License:** Tillerstead LLC is fully licensed (NJ HIC #13VH10808800) with $1M liability coverage and current Workers' Compensation.

## TCNA Handbook Standards {#tcna-standards}

### What is TCNA?

**TCNA** = **Tile Council of North America**, the industry authority on tile installation methods.

The TCNA Handbook defines installation methods that meet ANSI (American National Standards Institute) requirements. New Jersey building codes reference TCNA methods for tile installations.

### Key TCNA Standards for Showers

**ANSI A108 Series:**
- A108.1A - Ceramic Tile Installation Methods
- A108.10 - Installation of Grout in Tile Work
- A108.11 - Interior Installation of Cementitious Backer Units
- A108.13 - Load-Bearing, Bonded Waterproof Membranes

**ANSI A118 Series:**
- A118.10 - Waterproofing Membranes (CRITICAL)
- A118.4 - Modified Dry-Set Cement Mortar
- A118.6 - Polymer Modified Dry-Set Cement Grout

### TCNA Method TR716 (Standard Shower)

**The most common method for residential showers:**

**Layer 1:** Studs (16" on center)  
**Layer 2:** Vapor barrier (6-mil polyethylene)  
**Layer 3:** Cement board (1/2" minimum)  
**Layer 4:** Waterproofing membrane (ANSI A118.10)  
**Layer 5:** Mortar bed (bond coat)  
**Layer 6:** Tile  
**Layer 7:** Grout (ANSI A118.6)  

**Shower Pan Assembly:**
- Pre-slope mortar bed (1/4" per foot to drain)
- Liner membrane (40-mil PVC or CPE)
- Mortar bed (1-1/4" minimum at drain)
- Tile (1/4" per foot slope maintained)

> **Code Requirement:** NJ requires waterproofing membranes meet ANSI A118.10 standards. Common products: Schluter Kerdi, Laticrete Hydroban, RedGard.

## Waterproofing Code Requirements {#waterproofing-codes}

### NJ-Specific Waterproofing Standards

**Mandatory Requirements:**
1. **ANSI A118.10 Compliance**
   - Sheet membranes OR liquid-applied

   - No visible leaks
   - Inspector must witness OR photo documentation

3. **Membrane Height**
   - Walls: 6" above shower head height

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I install my own tile shower in NJ?

**A:** Yes, if it's your primary residence and you pull the permit yourself. However:
- You're responsible for code compliance
- Failed inspections delay project
- Insurance may not cover DIY work
- Resale requires disclosure
- Most homeowners hire professionals due to complexity

### Q: How long does the permit process take?

**A:** Typical timeline:
- Permit application: 1-2 days to prepare
- Plan review: 3-10 business days
- Permit issuance: Same day after approval
- **Total: 5-15 business days**

Rush permits available in some municipalities for additional fee.

### Q: What happens if I get caught without a permit?

**A:** Consequences:
1. Stop Work Order (immediate halt)
2. Obtain permit retroactively
3. Pay double permit fees ($300-1,000)
4. Remove work for inspection (walls opened)
5. Possible fines ($500-2,000 per day)
6. Difficulty selling home

### Q: Do I need TCNA certification to install tile?

**A:** No certification required for contractors in NJ. However:
- TCNA methods are code-referenced
- Following TCNA ensures compliance
- Many contractors advertise "TCNA-compliant" work
- Some attend TCNA training courses

### Q: Can inspectors fail me for workmanship?

**A:** Partially. Inspectors check:
- **Code compliance: YES** (must meet code)
- **Safety: YES** (must be safe)
- **Aesthetic quality: NO** (not their jurisdiction)

Example: Crooked tiles aren't a code violation, but missing waterproofing is.

### Q: What if my contractor doesn't want to get a permit?

**A:** Major red flag. They're likely:
- Unlicensed (can't pull permits)
- Uninsured (afraid of documentation)
- Cutting corners (won't pass inspection)

**Action:** Find a different contractor. Legal and compliant work requires permits.
