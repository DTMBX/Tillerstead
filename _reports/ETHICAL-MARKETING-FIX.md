## How to Build REAL Reviews (Ethical Growth)

### Step 1: Ask Recent Clients (This Week)
**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Quick favor - Would you review our work?

Hi [Name],

We recently completed your [bathroom/shower/tile] project and I hope you're loving the results!

If you have 2 minutes, would you mind leaving a review? It helps other homeowners find us.

Choose your preferred platform:
- Google: [link]
- Thumbtack: [link]
- Yelp: [link]
- Facebook: [link]

Thanks so much!
Devon Tyler
Tillerstead LLC
```

### Step 2: Make It Easy
- Create Google Business Profile (if not done)
- Send direct review links (not just profile)
- Offer multiple platforms (Google, Thumbtack, Yelp, Facebook)
- Follow up once after 1 week

### Step 3: Incentivize LEGALLY
**ALLOWED:**
- "We appreciate reviews!" (general encouragement)
- Entry into monthly drawing (must disclose in review)
- Donate $25 to charity for each review (disclose)

**NOT ALLOWED:**
- Pay for reviews
- Discount for five-star reviews
- Threaten negative consequences
- Filter/hide negative reviews

### Step 4: Timeline to Real Reviews
**Month 1:** Reach out to last 10 clients → expect 2-4 reviews  
**Month 2:** Ask new clients immediately after completion → 2-3 reviews  
**Month 3:** Send follow-up to past clients → 1-2 more reviews  

**90-Day Goal:** 10-15 genuine five-star reviews

**Good:** "3 Thumbtack Top Pro Reviews - Working to Earn Yours"
