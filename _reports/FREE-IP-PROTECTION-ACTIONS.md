## 💡 WHY THIS WORKS

### Common Law Trademark Rights
Under federal law (Lanham Act 15 U.S.C. § 1127), you **automatically own** trademark rights from the moment you first use a mark in commerce. Registration is NOT required.

**What You Get:**
- Right to use the mark in your geographic area
- Right to stop others from using confusingly similar marks
- Right to sue for trademark infringement
- Priority over anyone who starts using it AFTER you

**What Registration Adds:**
- Nationwide protection (vs. regional)
- ® symbol (looks more professional)
- Presumption of validity (you don't have to prove ownership)
- Statutory damages (up to $200k for willful infringement)
- Easier to enforce

### Why Timestamps Matter
**Trademark law = First to Use, NOT First to File**

If someone files a federal trademark for "Where Craft Meets Accountability" tomorrow, but you can PROVE you used it first, **you win**.

That's why these FREE actions are so valuable:
1. Wayback Machine = Third-party timestamp
2. Email = Server log timestamp  
3. First Use Docs = Evidence trail

**Real Example:**  
Acme Corp files ® for "CraftAccountable" in 2026.  
You used "Where Craft Meets Accountability" since 2024.  
You show Wayback snapshot from Aug 2024.  
**Result:** Their registration is cancelled, you keep using your mark.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I just write down the dates myself?**  
A: That's weak evidence. You need **third-party verification** like email servers, Wayback Machine, Git commits, or notarization.

**Q: What if I can't remember exact first use dates?**  
A: Be conservative. Use the LATEST possible date you're certain about. Better to say "Oct 2024" than claim "Aug 2024" and get caught lying.

**Q: Should I notarize the first use document?**  
A: Optional but recommended ($15-25). Notary adds legal weight. Visit any UPS Store, bank, or AAA office.

**Q: Do I need to archive every month?**  
A: No. One good snapshot per year is fine. But do it ASAP for the first time to establish your baseline.

**Q: What if my website changes later?**  
A: That's fine. This snapshot proves you used the marks on THIS date. Future changes don't invalidate past use.

**Q: Can I delete the email after saving screenshots?**  
A: **NEVER.** The email timestamp is the legal proof. Screenshots alone are weak (can be Photoshopped).
