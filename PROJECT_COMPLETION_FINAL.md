## Key Features

### Global Theme Control

```scss
// Edit once, updates everywhere
$color-primary: #1a5c3a;    ← Changes all buttons, links, headings
$spacing-lg: 24px;          ← Changes all spacing proportionally
$font-size-base: 16px;      ← Scales all typography
```

### Script Risk Classification

```
Class A (High Risk)    → Client-impacting, compliance-heavy
Class B (Medium Risk)  → Build automation, operations
Class C (Low Risk)     → Educational content, visualization
```

### Governance System

- Risk grading (R0-R3)
- Compliance checklists
- Decision logging
- Review requirements
- Documentation standards
