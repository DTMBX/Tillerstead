## What This Cleanup Accomplishes

### ✅ Reduced Cognitive Load

- 7 fewer unused includes to maintain
- 13 fewer archive files cluttering root
- Clear navigation: only essential docs at root level

### ✅ Faster Onboarding

- New developers see 4 key docs instead of 17
- Instruction docs clearly organized for jobsite teams
- ARCHIVE.md provides historical context without noise

### ✅ Easier Maintenance

- 30 includes are all active
- No dead code paths to debug
- Consolidated archives prevent duplication

### ✅ Zero Breaking Changes

- All active functionality preserved
- No changes to templates or components
- Build system unaffected

## Next Actions (Optional)

If desired, can also clean:

1. **Reports directory** — Archive all reports to `reports/ARCHIVE.md`
2. **Build logs** — Remove `build_trace.log`, `_tmp_build_output.txt`
3. **Backups** — Remove `.backup` files

Current cleanup focused only on **active code and documentation**.
