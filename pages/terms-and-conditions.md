## Terms & Conditions

**Last updated:** June 2024

### 1. General Terms

All website content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a binding offer, estimate, or legal agreement. Binding terms, pricing, and schedules are established exclusively through a written proposal or contract, signed by both Tillerstead LLC and the client, in accordance with the New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor (New Jersey HIC) Act and TCNA standards ([New Jersey HIC Law](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/hic)).

### 2. Services & Estimates

Verbal, phone, email, or web-based estimates are non-binding until confirmed in a signed, written proposal that details scope, materials, and pricing. All work is performed strictly as described in the final, New Jersey HIC-compliant contract. Changes to scope require a written change order, subject to adjusted pricing and scheduling. Tillerstead LLC reserves the right to revise or withdraw estimates if project details, site conditions, or material availability change.

Unauthorized use or reproduction is strictly prohibited.

### 4. Privacy & Information We Collect

Tillerstead LLC (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects only the information necessary to respond to your requests and fulfill our legal and contractual obligations as a licensed New Jersey contractor.

### 6. Cookies & Analytics
