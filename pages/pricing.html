      <h2>What Does Professional Tile Work Actually Cost?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        These are honest ranges based on common project types and real-world
        conditions in South Jersey homes. We provide written scope, clear
        inclusions/exclusions, and a workmanship warranty. Wet areas are built
        as complete assemblies (slope, drain integration, waterproofing
        continuity) before tile.

        Pricing below is for labor + standard installation materials unless
        noted. Tile, fixtures, and specialty finishes vary.

      <h2>💡 Why Prices Vary</h2>
      <p>
        Final pricing depends on what the project actually needs—not just square
        footage:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Demo and existing conditions:</strong> hidden damage, mold
          remediation needs, or prior failures
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Substrate condition:</strong> whether walls/floors need
          correction before tile
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tile format and material:</strong> large-format tile and stone
          demand tighter tolerances and more prep
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pattern complexity:</strong> herringbone, mosaics, borders,
          niches, benches
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transitions:</strong> thresholds, trims, edges, door jambs,
          and adjacent flooring
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access and logistics:</strong> stairs, parking, carrying
          distance, protection requirements
        </li>
