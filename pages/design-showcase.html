        Design That’s Built—Not Just Drawn
      </h2>
      <p class="ts-section-subtitle">
        A great tile layout isn’t only about pattern. It’s about
        <strong>lines that land cleanly</strong>,
        <strong>materials that behave correctly</strong>, and wet areas that are
        built as complete assemblies before tile goes in.

        <h3>Pattern Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Layout is planned around sightlines, symmetry, and practical cut
          strategy—so the finish reads cleanly from the doorway, not just from a
          close-up photo.

      <article class="about-card">
        <h3>System-First Execution</h3>
        <p>
          In showers and wet areas, the priority is water management: slope,
          drain integration, and waterproofing continuity. Tile follows a
          verified system—not the other way around.

        Our Design Philosophy
      </h2>
      <p class="ts-section-subtitle">
        Your design should look intentional—and it should be serviceable for
        years. We prioritize alignment, clean transitions, and assemblies
        appropriate to the room’s exposure.
      </p>

      <article class="why-item">
        <h3>Layout That Lands Cleanly</h3>
        <p>
          We plan cuts, centers, and pattern starts so focal walls and main
          sightlines look balanced. That means fewer slivers, cleaner corners,
          and better-looking transitions.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="why-item">
        <h3>Material-Driven Choices</h3>
        <p>
          Different tile formats demand different prep and setting approaches.
          Large-format tile and stone require tighter surface tolerances,
          compatible mortars, and careful sequencing to avoid lippage and hollow
          spots.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="why-item">
        <h3>Wet Areas Built as Assemblies</h3>
        <p>
          In showers, waterproofing is not a coating—it’s an integrated assembly
          tied into the drain and detailed at corners, penetrations, and
          transitions. Verification happens before finishes conceal the work.
        </p>

      <article class="why-item">
        <h3>Maintenance and Real Life</h3>
        <p>
          The best design still needs to live well. We consider cleaning
          practicality, grout joint strategy, shelf/niche placement, and
          transition detailing that holds up under daily use.

        Beautiful tile is the result of preparation and verification. While
        finishes are what you see, durability comes from the layers below.

      <article class="why-item">
        <h3>Substrate Preparation</h3>
        <p>
          Surfaces are evaluated for flatness and readiness appropriate to the
          tile format. Where correction is required, prep is performed before
          tile setting begins—because thinset is not a patching strategy.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="why-item">
        <h3>Waterproofing Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Wet areas use waterproofing components appropriate to the chosen
          system and application, with attention to corners, seams,
          penetrations, and drain transition. Verification is completed before
          tile.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="why-item">
        <h3>Coverage Verification</h3>
        <p>
          Bond integrity depends on coverage. Coverage is checked during
          installation—especially in wet areas and with large-format tile— to
          reduce hollow spots and premature failures.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="why-item">
        <h3>Movement Accommodation</h3>
        <p>
          Assemblies must move without cracking. Perimeter and plane-change
          detailing is planned so the tile finish stays stable as the structure
          expands and contracts.

      <strong>Standards note:</strong>
      Our tile assemblies reference published industry methods (TCNA Handbook)

      building code requirements apply to the project scope, we coordinate
      accordingly as part of compliant home improvement work (NJ HIC
