      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Estimates:</strong> Send plans/takeoffs or schedule a walk.
          Proposals include written scope, assumptions, and material allowances
          where needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scheduling:</strong> Dates are confirmed in writing when site
          readiness is verified (substrate condition, waterproofing strategy,
          trade access, and materials on site).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Change orders:</strong> If scope changes, pricing is
          documented and approved before additional work proceeds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Handoffs:</strong> Brief updates at key stages (pre-tile
          readiness, waterproofing complete, setting complete, ready for next
          trade).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closeout:</strong> Photo log + punch completion notes for
          straightforward turnover.
