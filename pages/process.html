          Most tile and bathroom failures don’t happen because of the tile you
          chose. They happen because of skipped prep, incomplete waterproofing,
          or assumptions made before the work was verified. Our process is
          designed to surface issues early, document decisions, and confirm
          readiness before finishes go in.

            <p>
              Flatness issues, deflection, moisture exposure, and drain
              placement all determine whether a tile assembly succeeds. Catching
              and correcting these items before tile prevents expensive
              tear-outs later.

            <h3 class="heading-4">Verification Beats Assumptions</h3>
            <p>
              Thinset doesn’t fix bad prep, and grout doesn’t stop water.
              Readiness checks and system verification reduce the risk of
              cracked tile, leaks, and premature failure.

              Photo documentation and written scope protect you, the installer,
              and future owners by showing what was built— not just what it
              looks like after completion.

        <ul class="ts-list">
          <li>
            <strong>You know what’s included:</strong> scope and materials are
            defined before work starts.

            <strong>You know what’s happening:</strong> decisions and changes
            are discussed before they affect cost or schedule.

          <li>
            <strong>You know what was built:</strong> key phases are documented

            <strong>You avoid last-minute surprises:</strong> issues are

          This approach isn’t flashy—but it’s why properly built tile assemblies
          last.
