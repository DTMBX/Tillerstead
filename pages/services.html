    <section class="service-section" id="tile" aria-labelledby="tile-heading">
      <h2 id="tile-heading">Tile Installation & Wet-Area Waterproofing</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        We treat tile as a system: structure, substrate, setting materials,
        waterproofing (where applicable), and movement accommodation. Our
        baselines are the <strong>TCNA Handbook (2025)</strong> and applicable
        <strong>ANSI A108 / A118 / A136.1</strong> standards, with movement
        joints planned per <strong>TCNA EJ171</strong> based on conditions.
      </p>

      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Showers, tub surrounds, and other wet areas:</strong>
          Waterproofing is selected and installed as a complete system (sheet or
          liquid-applied) that meets the appropriate ANSI requirements (commonly
          <strong>A118.10</strong> for load-bearing bonded waterproof
          membranes). Seams, corners, penetrations, and drain connections are
          detailed per the manufacturer’s instructions and the specified method.
          <a href="/blog/waterproofing-redgard-vs-kerdi-vs-hydroban/"
            >Our detailed waterproofing comparison explains system selection and
            installation specifics.</a
          >
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Pre-slope, drainage, and “details that fail first”:</strong>
          We focus on transitions, corners, curbs, niches, benches, and
          terminations—because that’s where water finds shortcuts. Where a
          shower pan or wet-area method calls for a water test, we can perform a
          documented flood test per the selected system requirements and local
          inspection expectations.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Substrate evaluation & prep:</strong>
          We verify flatness for the chosen tile size, address bond-breakers and
          contaminants, and select underlayment/uncoupling/crack isolation
          approaches based on the substrate and use-case. Where crack isolation
          is specified, products meeting <strong>ANSI A118.12</strong> are used
          as applicable.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Large-format tile (LFT) and plank tile:</strong>
          Flatness, mortar selection, trowel strategy, and technique are chosen
          to target proper coverage and reduce lippage risk.
          <a href="/blog/large-format-tile-flatness-mortars-trowels/"
            >See our detailed guide to large-format tile installation for
            substrate, mortar, and technique specifications.</a
          >
          Where appropriate, we use lippage-control systems and plan layout
          around focal lines and terminations—without forcing “pretty” choices
          that compromise function.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Floors (tile):</strong>
          We evaluate structure and deflection suitability for the finish
          (commonly L/360 for ceramic/porcelain, stricter criteria for natural
          stone depending on the assembly). Movement accommodation is planned at
          perimeters, changes of plane, and within fields as conditions require
          (EJ171 guidance).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Backsplashes & wall tile:</strong>
          Clean cuts, finished edges, and correct changes-of-plane detailing.
          Penetrations (outlets, valves, fixtures) are cut and sealed
          appropriately, and transitions are finished with compatible trim or
          sealant based on the application.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Heated floors (electric radiant):</strong>
          Installed per the system manufacturer’s instructions, with staged
          resistance testing documented where the manufacturer specifies it.
          Controls, sensors, and required electrical protections are coordinated
          with properly licensed electrical work when required.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Grout, sealants, and movement joints:</strong>
          We select grout and sealant types appropriate to the location (wet
          area vs. dry, chemical exposure, movement). Changes of plane and
          movement joints are treated as functional parts of the assembly—not
          optional cosmetics.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        Compliance note: Where permits or inspections apply (scope-dependent),
        work is coordinated in line with the New Jersey Uniform Construction
        Code and local requirements. Plumbing/electrical/HVAC/structural scope
        is performed by or referred to properly licensed trades as required.
