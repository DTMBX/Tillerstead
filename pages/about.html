      <h2 id="details-heading">Why Details Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Tile problems usually don’t start at the surface. They start underneath:
        poor substrate prep, inadequate flatness, skipped movement
        accommodation, or a wet area that was never built as a true
        waterproofing assembly. That’s why our work begins with
        verification—then we build the system to the requirements of the
        selected method and materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        We don’t treat mortars and membranes as interchangeable. Material
        selection follows published specifications (including applicable ANSI
        classifications and manufacturer data sheets), and movement
        accommodation is planned and installed where required (including TCNA
        EJ171 guidance for movement joints).
      </p>

      <p>
        In showers and wet areas, waterproofing is constructed as a complete
        assembly—including transitions, penetrations, and drain integration—
        then verified before tile. Where testing is required or
        method-appropriate, we perform it and document it.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        The goal is simple: fewer surprises, fewer callbacks, and a bathroom you
        don’t have to think about.

      <h2 id="process-heading">How We Work</h2>
      <p>
        Most homeowners don’t want to manage trades—they want a clear plan and a
        clean result. Here’s what you can expect:
      </p>

      <ul class="ts-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Written scope &amp; contract:</strong> scope, materials,
          schedule approach, payment terms, and warranty—before work begins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verification before finishes:</strong> substrate readiness,
          wet-area system steps, and pre-tile checks are confirmed before
          covering work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Documentation you can keep:</strong> key-phase photos compiled
          for owner records and future maintenance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear communication:</strong> timely updates, and direct
          answers—especially when decisions affect cost or timeline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Change orders in writing:</strong> scope or price changes are
          approved before we proceed—no surprise invoices.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight-box" role="note">
        <strong>What this prevents:</strong> vague quotes, “we’ll figure it out
        later,” and expensive corrections after tile is installed.

      <h2 id="fit-heading">Who We’re a Good Fit For</h2>

      <p>
        We're best for NJ homeowners who value durability and clear
        expectations—especially in showers, bathrooms, and other wet areas.
      </p>

      <ul class="ts-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Good fit:</strong> you want the build done right, documented,
          and explained in plain language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Good fit:</strong> you care about prep, waterproofing, and
          long-term performance—not just fast completion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not a fit:</strong> you’re shopping strictly for the lowest
          number and don’t want verification steps.
        </li>
      </ul>

        If you’re not sure, that’s fine—our estimate process is designed to
        clarify scope and options early.
