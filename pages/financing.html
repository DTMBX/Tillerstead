        Payment Options for Tile &amp; Bath Projects
      </h1>

      <p class="lead">
        Long-lasting tile work depends on proper prep, correct system selection,
        and disciplined sequencing. If budget is a constraint, we structure
        scope in phases or you can explore third-party financing—without
        skipping steps that cause failures later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every project starts with a written scope and a clear plan. You’ll know
        what’s included, what’s excluded, and how changes are handled before
        work begins. For tile work, our installation approach references TCNA
        methods and applicable ANSI A108/A118 standards, plus manufacturer
        requirements for the chosen products and systems.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-3">Your Options</h2>
      <ul class="financing-options ts-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Pay in full:</strong> Ideal for smaller scopes or fast
          turnarounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Milestone-based payments:</strong> Deposit + progress payments
          tied to verifiable completion steps (defined in writing).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Phase the project:</strong> Prioritize what matters most now
          (e.g., waterproofing + shower, then floors/finishes later).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-party financing:</strong> Apply through Acorn Finance to
          view offers from multiple lenders (if qualified).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-3">How It Works</h2>
      <ol class="financing-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Scope &amp; plan:</strong> On-site review, measurements, and a
          written scope. If phasing makes sense, we outline phases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Written proposal:</strong> Line-item estimate and clear terms
          (scope boundaries, schedule assumptions, and change-order process).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose payment method:</strong> Pay in full, milestone
          payments, or apply for third-party financing through Acorn Finance.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="microcopy">
        Financing is optional. We don’t rush prep or skip waterproofing details
        to make numbers “fit.” We’d rather phase scope than build something that
        fails.
