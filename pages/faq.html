              We serve homeowners throughout
              <strong>Atlantic, Ocean, and Cape May Counties</strong> in South
              Jersey. This includes towns like Egg Harbor Township, Galloway,

              areas.

            <p>
              Yes. Tillerstead LLC is a
              <strong

          <summary>What is your warranty?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              We provide a <strong>2-year workmanship warranty</strong> on all
              installations. This covers defects in our work—not normal wear,
              homeowner damage, or issues caused by settling or structural
              movement. Manufacturer warranties on materials (tile, membranes,
              grout) are separate and typically longer.

          <summary>Do I get a written contract?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              Absolutely. Per New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act requirements, every
              project over $500 includes a written contract detailing scope of
              work, materials, timeline, payment schedule, and your 3-day right
              of rescission. You'll never be surprised by what's included—or not
              included.

            <p>
              Contact us through our
              <a href="/contact/">estimate request form</a> or call
              <a href="tel:+16098628808">(609) 862-8808</a>. We'll schedule a
              site visit to assess your space, discuss your goals, and provide a
              detailed written estimate. There's no charge and no obligation.

          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              When permits are required, yes. Bathroom remodels involving
              plumbing, structural changes, or electrical work typically need
              permits. We handle the permit process and coordinate inspections.
              Some cosmetic-only work may be exempt—we'll clarify this during
              the estimate.

          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Timelines vary by scope:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tile-only projects:</strong> 3-7 days</li>
              <li>

            <p>
              We provide a specific timeline in your contract. Delays can occur
              due to permit scheduling, material lead times, or discovery of

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Deposit:</strong> 30-50% at contract signing (covers

              Smaller projects may use a simpler 50/50 structure. All payment

          <summary>What is TCNA and why does it matter?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              The
              <strong>Tile Council of North America (TCNA)</strong> publishes
              the industry-standard Handbook for Ceramic, Glass, and Stone Tile
              Installation. It defines tested methods for substrate prep,
              waterproofing, and tile installation that prevent failures.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we say "TCNA-compliant," we mean we follow these proven
              methods—not shortcuts or guesswork. This matters because most tile
              failures trace back to skipped steps in the TCNA sequence.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Do you do flood testing?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              When project scope and site conditions allow, yes. Flood testing
              per ASTM D5957 verifies that the shower pan holds water
              <em>before</em> tile conceals the assembly. It's the only way to
              confirm waterproofing integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not all projects require or allow flood testing (some modern
              bonded systems are verified differently), but when applicable, we
              document results with photos.

          <summary>What waterproofing systems do you use?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              We use <strong>ANSI A118.10 compliant</strong> waterproofing
              systems appropriate to each project:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Sheet membranes:</strong> Schluter DITRA/KERDI,
                Laticrete Hydro Ban Board
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Liquid-applied membranes:</strong> Laticrete Hydro Ban,
                Custom RedGard
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Traditional systems:</strong> Hot-mopped or CPE liners
                (for specific applications)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              System selection depends on substrate, drain type, and project
              requirements. We never mix incompatible systems.

          <summary>Can you install large-format tile?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              Yes. Large-format tile (any side over 15") requires specific
              techniques:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Substrate flatness to ANSI standards (1/8" in 10')</li>
              <li>Full coverage back-buttering</li>
              <li>Appropriate lippage control systems</li>
              <li>Medium-bed mortars for irregular substrates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We assess substrate conditions during the estimate and include any
              necessary prep work in the scope.

          <summary>What about heated floors?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              We install electric radiant floor heating systems under tile. This
              requires:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Proper subfloor evaluation</li>
              <li>Uncoupling membrane compatibility</li>
              <li>Coordination with electrician for thermostat/circuit</li>
              <li>Modified thinset for heat-system compatibility</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Either approach works:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>We supply:</strong> We source tile through trade
                accounts, often at better pricing than retail. We handle
                ordering, delivery, and overage calculations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>You supply:</strong> You choose and purchase tile
                yourself. We'll advise on quantity (including 10-15% overage)
                and verify suitability for your application.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Installation materials (thinset, grout, waterproofing) are
              typically included in our scope regardless of who supplies tile.

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What grout do you recommend?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              For most applications, we recommend
              <strong>epoxy or urethane grouts</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Stain-resistant without sealing</li>
              <li>Color-consistent over time</li>
              <li>More durable in wet areas</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Traditional cement grouts are still appropriate for some
              applications. We'll discuss options and their maintenance
              requirements during planning.

          <summary>Can I use natural stone in a shower?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Yes, with proper planning. Natural stone requires:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sealing (initial and periodic maintenance)</li>
              <li>Appropriate slope for drainage</li>
              <li>Compatible setting materials</li>
              <li>Understanding of maintenance requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Some stones (marble, limestone) are more porous and require more
              attention than others (granite, slate). We'll discuss realistic
              expectations during consultation.
