# Common Failures & Red Flags

## Step 8 of the Construction Order — How Problems Start, and How They’re Prevented

This page ties the entire Build Phase together by explaining **where bathroom and shower failures actually originate**, what warning signs homeowners can recognize early, and why shortcuts nearly always cost more later.

Most failures are not sudden. They are the predictable result of decisions made—or skipped—earlier in the build.

---

## The Core Reality

> **Nearly every shower failure can be traced to something that happened before tile was installed.**

Tile, grout, and sealant are often blamed because they are visible. The real causes are usually hidden beneath finished surfaces.

---

## Failure Pattern 1: Skipped or Rushed Planning

**What it looks like:**

* Drain type chosen late
* Curbless decisions made after framing
* Bench or niche added mid-build

**Why it fails:**

* Systems become incompatible
* Slopes and elevations can’t be corrected later
* Waterproofing continuity is compromised

**Prevention:**

* Lock drain, curb/curbless, and waterproofing decisions before demo

---

## Failure Pattern 2: Improper Slope

**What it looks like:**

* Standing water after use
* Dark grout lines near the drain
* Odor or slow drying

**Why it fails:**

* Flat or inconsistent slope beneath waterproofing
* Attempting to correct slope with thinset

**Prevention:**

* Minimum 1/4" per foot slope built into the waterproofing layer

---

## Failure Pattern 3: Incompatible Systems

**What it looks like:**

* Surface membrane paired with clamping drain
* Mixed waterproofing products without approval

**Why it fails:**

* No continuous waterproofing plane
* Drain connection cannot be verified

**Prevention:**

* One coherent system from drain to walls

---

## Failure Pattern 4: Framing Movement

**What it looks like:**

* Cracked grout at benches or niches
* Tile separation at corners

**Why it fails:**

* Insufficient blocking
* Unsupported benches or shelves
* Deflection beyond tile tolerances

**Prevention:**

* Treat benches and niches as structural elements

---

## Failure Pattern 5: Waterproofing Gaps

**What it looks like:**

* Leaks appearing outside the shower
* Damage weeks or months after completion

**Why it fails:**

* Waterproofing stops short at transitions
* Penetrations not properly sealed
* Fasteners through horizontal surfaces

**Prevention:**

* Continuous, inspectable waterproofing before tile

---

## Failure Pattern 6: Insufficient Tile Coverage

**What it looks like:**

* Hollow-sounding tiles
* Cracked corners
* Loose tile over time

**Why it fails:**

* Poor substrate flatness
* Incorrect mortar or trowel
* No coverage verification during install

**Prevention:**

* Coverage checks during installation, not after

---

## Failure Pattern 7: Skipping Verification

**What it looks like:**

* No flood test performed
* No documentation or inspection record

**Why it fails:**

* Leaks discovered only after finishes are complete

**Prevention:**

* Flood testing or equivalent verification before tile

---

## Red Flags Homeowners Can Spot

* “We’ll fix it with tile.”
* “That’s how we’ve always done it.”
* “Inspection isn’t necessary for this.”
* “Curbless means fewer rules.”
* Waterproofing hidden immediately without verification

These phrases signal risk, not efficiency.

---

## What Quality Looks Like Instead

* Decisions made before demolition
* Systems explained clearly and consistently
* Inspections treated as checkpoints, not obstacles
* Verification performed before finishes
* Problems prevented, not patched

---

## Key Takeaways

* Failures are predictable and preventable
* Shortcuts shift cost from construction to repair
* Verification protects everyone involved
* Durable bathrooms are built, not improvised
