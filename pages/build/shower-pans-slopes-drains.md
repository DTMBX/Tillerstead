# Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains

## Step 2 of the Construction Order — Water Management Before Tile

This page explains **how showers actually manage water**, why slope and drain selection matter more than tile, and what New Jersey inspectors are looking for *before* waterproofing and finishes.

This guide follows **TCNA 2024 Handbook** guidance on pan design, pre-slope systems, and drainage—the foundation that prevents failure.

Most shower failures originate here.

---

## The Core Principle

> **Waterproofing and drainage must work before tile is installed.**

Tile and grout are finishes—not water control systems. Code compliance and long-term performance depend on what happens beneath them.

---

## Required Shower Slope (Non-Negotiable)

Under model plumbing codes adopted by New Jersey:

* Shower floors must slope a **minimum of 1/4 inch per foot** toward the drain
* The slope must be **continuous** and **uniform**
* Flat areas or reverse pitch are not acceptable

### Critical clarification

The slope must exist in the **waterproofing layer**, not just in the tile surface.

---

## Drain Type Determines the System

Before a pan is built, the drain type must be selected. Mixing drain types and waterproofing methods is a common cause of failure.

### Bonded (Surface-Applied) Drains

Characteristics:

* Waterproof membrane bonds directly to the drain flange
* The entire waterproofing layer is sloped
* Tile is installed directly on the membrane

Typical use:

* Modern showers
* Curbless designs
* Custom or pre-sloped pans

### Traditional Clamping Drains

Characteristics:

* Waterproof liner is clamped between drain components
* Requires a **pre-slope under the liner**
* Mortar bed is placed above the liner

Critical risk:

* Skipping the pre-slope traps water and leads to failure

---

## Custom Sloped Pans vs. Pre-Formed Trays

Both approaches are permitted when properly executed.

### Site-Built (Custom) Sloped Pans

Used when:

* Drain is off-center
* Shower dimensions are non-standard
* Framing irregularities exist
* Precise plane control is required

Key requirement:

* Constructed using **dry-pack deck mud**, sloped uniformly to the drain

### Pre-Formed Trays

Used when:

* Shower size matches manufacturer dimensions
* Drain location is fixed
* Subfloor is flat and level

Key limitation:

* Trays cannot compensate for framing errors

---

## Drain Height & Finished Floor Planning

Drain height must be set **before** the pan is built.

Proper planning accounts for:

* Tile thickness
* Thinset thickness
* Finished floor elevation at the drain

The drain should finish flush with or slightly below the tile surface—never recessed or crowned.

---

## Curbs, Thresholds & Drain Relationship

Where a curb is used:

* The finished curb top is typically required to be **at least 2 inches above the drain**
* This requirement addresses water containment

Curbless showers meet the same intent through:

* Floor elevation planning
* Additional slope outside the wet area
* Drain placement and capacity

(Details are covered fully in the Curbs vs. Curbless section.)

---

## Inspection Expectations at the Pan Stage

Inspectors may verify:

* Drain type and installation
* Presence of required slope
* Waterproofing continuity
* Compatibility of system components

Some municipalities require a dedicated pan or waterproofing inspection before tile.

---

## Common Failure Points

* Flat or inconsistent slope
* Drain incompatible with waterproofing system
* Missing pre-slope in traditional liner systems
* Improper drain height planning
* Attempting to correct slope with thinset

Once tile is installed, these issues are difficult or impossible to correct.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Slope belongs in the waterproofing layer
* Drain type dictates the entire system
* Custom pans are valid when properly built
* Planning happens before materials are mixed

## Next Step in the Build Phase

**Waterproofing Systems (Surface vs. Traditional)**
How water is contained and directed once slope and drainage are established.
