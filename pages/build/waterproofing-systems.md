# Waterproofing Systems (Surface vs. Traditional)

## Step 3 of the Construction Order — Containment Before Finishes

This page explains **how showers are waterproofed**, the two primary system types used in New Jersey residential construction, and why continuity and compatibility matter more than brand names.

Waterproofing is a system—not a product.

---

## The Core Principle

> **Water must be contained and directed to the drain before any finish materials are installed.**

Tile, grout, and sealers are not waterproofing. The waterproofing layer is a separate assembly whose job is to manage water under normal use and during drain interruptions.

---

## The Two Accepted Waterproofing Approaches

New Jersey inspectors generally encounter two code-compliant shower waterproofing approaches when properly executed.

---

## 1) Surface-Applied (Bonded) Waterproofing Systems

**What they are:**

* Waterproof membranes applied on top of the sloped substrate
* The membrane bonds directly to the drain flange
* Tile is installed directly on the membrane

**Key characteristics:**

* The entire waterproofing layer is sloped
* No saturated mortar bed beneath tile
* Rapid drying and clear inspection visibility

**Common applications:**

* Modern showers
* Curbless designs
* Custom site-built pans or pre-sloped trays

**Critical requirements:**

* Continuous membrane from walls to floor to drain
* Full bond at the drain flange
* Proper treatment of corners and penetrations

---

## 2) Traditional Liner (Clamping Drain) Systems

**What they are:**

* Waterproof liner installed below the mortar bed
* Liner clamped into a multi-piece drain
* Tile installed over a mortar bed above the liner

**Critical requirement (often missed):**

* A **pre-slope** must exist *under* the liner to direct water to weep holes

**Key risks:**

* Saturated mortar beds
* Blocked weep holes
* Long dry times and odor issues

When properly constructed, traditional systems are code-compliant—but execution errors are common.

---

## System Compatibility (Why Mixing Fails)

Inspectors frequently reject showers where:

* A surface membrane is used with a clamping drain
* A liner system is combined with surface waterproofing without engineering
* Liquid and sheet systems are mixed without manufacturer approval

> A shower must function as **one coherent system**.

---

## Waterproofing Continuity

Regardless of system type, inspectors expect:

* Continuous waterproofing at walls, floors, curbs, and transitions
* Proper treatment of:

  * Inside and outside corners
  * Pipe penetrations
  * Valves and controls

Any interruption in the waterproofing plane is a failure point.

---

## Waterproofing Height at Walls

Typical expectations:

* Waterproofing extends above the showerhead height or to the ceiling
* At minimum, waterproofing continues well above all wet zones

Local interpretations vary; confirming expectations with the AHJ early avoids rework.

---

## Inspection & Verification

Inspectors may verify:

* Correct drain-to-membrane integration
* Membrane continuity
* Manufacturer installation compliance
* Flood test readiness (where required)

Waterproofing must be **inspectable before tile**.

---

## Common Waterproofing Failures

* Waterproofing applied flat over a sloped requirement
* Membrane stopping short of the drain
* Incompatible drain selection
* Unsealed penetrations
* Relying on tile or grout for water containment

Once tile is installed, waterproofing defects are hidden and costly to correct.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Waterproofing is a system, not a coating
* Drain choice dictates waterproofing method
* Continuity matters more than brand
* Inspectability is part of compliance
