# Curbs, Curbless Showers & Thresholds

## Step 4 of the Construction Order — Containing Water at the Entry

This page explains **why shower curbs exist**, how curbless showers are permitted in New Jersey, and what inspectors are evaluating when reviewing thresholds and transitions.

Curbs are not decorative. They are a water-containment device.

---

## The Code Intent (Plain Language)

> **The shower entry must prevent water from leaving the wet area under normal use and during temporary drain restriction.**

Whether achieved with a curb or a curbless design, the goal is the same: **containment and control**.

---

## Curbed Showers (Traditional Thresholds)

When a shower includes a curb, model plumbing codes adopted by New Jersey typically expect:

* A finished curb height **at least 2 inches above the drain**
* A curb that is not excessively wide or unsafe
* Waterproofing that fully wraps the curb

### What “2 inches above the drain” actually means

* Measured from the **top of the drain grate** to the **finished curb surface**
* Not measured from the bathroom floor
* Applies only when a curb is present

This requirement addresses splash-out and overflow risk.

---

## Curbless Showers (Zero-Threshold)

Curbless showers are **not prohibited** in New Jersey residential construction, but they are treated as **performance-based designs**.

Instead of relying on a curb, water containment is achieved through:

* Floor elevation planning
* Additional slope outside the wet area
* Strategic drain placement
* Drain capacity and grate design

> Removing the curb increases planning responsibility—it does not remove requirements.

---

## Common Curbless Design Strategies

Inspectors may accept curbless showers when they see:

* Continuous slope directing water inward
* Linear or trench drains placed at the entry
* Secondary slope outside the shower zone
* Clear waterproofing continuity beyond the wet area

Early coordination with the AHJ is strongly recommended.

---

## Accessibility vs. Residential Use

Accessibility standards (Barrier-Free Subcode / ICC A117.1) apply **only when legally triggered**, such as:

* Accessible dwelling units
* Public or common-use bathrooms

Standard residential remodels are **not automatically subject** to accessibility requirements, even when curbless designs are chosen.

---

## Waterproofing at Thresholds

Regardless of curb type:

* Waterproofing must be continuous across the threshold
* Transitions are common failure points
* Fasteners through horizontal waterproofing surfaces are prohibited

Thresholds must be treated as part of the waterproofing system, not as trim.

---

## Inspection Focus Areas

Inspectors commonly look for:

* Finished curb height relative to the drain
* Waterproofing continuity at the entry
* Evidence of planned water control
* Compatibility of drain and waterproofing system

Visual clarity and coherent design reduce inspection friction.

---

## Common Failure Patterns

* Treating curbless as "no rules"
* Flat bathroom floors outside the shower
* Waterproofing stopping at the shower opening
* Fasteners penetrating curbs or thresholds

These issues often require tear-out to correct.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Curbs exist to contain water
* Curbless showers rely on performance, not exemption
* Thresholds are part of the waterproofing system
* Early planning prevents late rejection
