# Flood Testing & Pre-Tile Verification

## Step 7 of the Construction Order — Proving the System Before It’s Hidden

Flood testing is the **last opportunity to verify waterproofing performance** before tile and grout permanently conceal the system. This step is about confirmation—not correction.

This guide references **ASTM D5957** flood testing standards and **TCNA 2024 Handbook** verification protocols. In New Jersey, flood testing may be **required, requested, or strongly recommended** depending on the municipality and the waterproofing method used.

---

## The Core Principle

> **If waterproofing cannot hold water temporarily, it cannot manage water long-term.**

Flood testing evaluates the integrity of the waterproofing system—not the tile, grout, or drain finish.

---

## What Flood Testing Is

Flood testing is a controlled process where:

* The drain is temporarily sealed below the waterproofing connection
* The shower base is filled with water
* The water level is monitored for loss over a defined period

The goal is to confirm:

* Waterproofing continuity
* Proper drain integration
* Integrity at seams, corners, and penetrations

---

## What Flood Testing Is *Not*

Flood testing is not:

* A test of tile or grout
* A substitute for proper slope
* A repair method
* A guarantee against future abuse or neglect

Flood testing verifies installation—not design shortcuts.

---

## When Flood Testing Occurs

Flood testing is performed:

* **After waterproofing is complete**
* **Before tile installation begins**

Testing after tile is installed is ineffective and can introduce unnecessary risk.

---

## Duration & Observation

Testing duration varies by:

* Local inspector requirements
* Manufacturer recommendations
* Project conditions

Common expectations include:

* Holding water long enough to observe stability
* Marking water level for visual reference
* Inspecting adjacent areas for leakage

Inspectors may witness the test or accept documentation, depending on jurisdiction.

---

## Inspector Expectations in New Jersey

Inspectors may:

* Require a flood test for certain systems
* Request confirmation that testing was performed
* Visually inspect waterproofing instead of witnessing a test

Clear communication with the local AHJ early in the project avoids delays.

---

## Common Flood Testing Mistakes

* Testing before waterproofing has cured
* Plugging the drain incorrectly
* Failing to mark the water level
* Testing a flat or improperly sloped pan
* Assuming flood testing is optional everywhere

An invalid test provides false confidence.

---

## What Happens If a Test Fails

If water loss or leakage is observed:

* Tile installation must stop
* Waterproofing defects must be identified
* Repairs must be completed and re-tested

This process protects the finished work and the structure below.

---

## Why Flood Testing Matters to Homeowners

Flood testing:

* Confirms water containment before finishes
* Reduces risk of hidden leaks
* Protects surrounding framing and finishes
* Provides peace of mind before tile conceals the system

It is a verification step—not a sales feature.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Flood testing verifies waterproofing performance
* It occurs before tile, not after
* Requirements vary by municipality
* Failed tests prevent far greater damage later
