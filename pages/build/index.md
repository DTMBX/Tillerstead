Welcome to the official build documentation for Tillerstead.com. This page outlines our site generation, deployment, and quality control workflows. All steps comply with TCNA 2024 and New Jersey HIC standards.

## The Build Phase

The **Build Phase** is Tillerstead’s standards-forward guide to bathroom and shower projects in New Jersey.  
It explains the *sequence*, the *verification points*, and the *common failure modes*—so expectations are clear before anything is sealed behind tile.

This is **not a DIY manual**. It’s an education and alignment resource for homeowners, designers, and contractors who want a durable, compliant result.


References include:

- TCNA Handbook methods
- ANSI tile standards
- ASTM testing guidance
- New Jersey Uniform Construction Code (UCC)

## Why These Guides Exist

Most bathroom failures don’t start with tile—they start earlier: at framing, waterproofing, slope, drainage, or skipped verification steps that are later hidden by finished surfaces.


These guides help you:

- Set clear expectations before construction begins
- Reduce surprises during the build
- Recognize quality workmanship
- Understand *why* each phase exists—not just *what* it is

---

## What We Build


- Code-aware bathroom and shower remodels planned around **permits, inspections, and verifiable system steps**
- Wet-area assemblies built as **systems** (structure → slope/drain → waterproofing → tile)
- Clear documentation habits (photos at key phases; verification before concealment)

## What We Don’t Do


- “Tile-over-problems” work that hides substrate, slope, or waterproofing issues
- Mixed-system waterproofing assemblies without manufacturer compatibility or engineering rationale
- Rushed sequencing that skips verification steps (especially before finishes conceal the work)

## The Construction Sequence: 8 Phases

Each phase builds on the one before it.  
For the full picture, read in order. If you’re researching a specific issue, you can jump directly to the relevant phase.


1. **[Codes, Permits & Inspections](/build/nj-codes-permits/):**  
   Understanding New Jersey’s construction code, permit requirements, and inspection sequence.

2. **[Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains](/build/shower-pans-slopes-drains/):**  
   How water is directed safely to the drain *before* tile is installed.

3. **[Waterproofing Systems](/build/waterproofing-systems/):**  
   Surface-applied vs. traditional systems, continuity, and compatibility.

4. **[Curbs & Curbless Showers](/build/curbs-curbless/):**  
   Containing water at the shower entry, including curbless designs permitted in NJ.

5. **[Framing for Benches, Seats & Niches](/build/framing-benches-niches/):**  
   Structural planning that must happen *before* waterproofing.

6. **[Tile Installation Standards](/build/tile-installation-standards/):**  
   How tile is bonded to the system and why preparation matters more than tile choice.

7. **[Flood Testing & Verification](/build/flood-testing/):**  
   The final opportunity to verify waterproofing before finishes conceal the work.

8. **[Common Failures & Red Flags](/build/common-build-failures/):**  
   Where failures originate, warning signs to watch for, and how proper sequencing prevents them.

## How to Use These Guides


**Homeowners:**  
Read in order to understand what quality construction actually involves.

**Designers & Architects:**  
Use these phases to coordinate details and sequencing.

**Contractors:**  
Share these guides to align expectations and document methodology.

## The Build Phase Difference

| Shortcut Mentality           | Build Phase Method                |
|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Focus on finishes            | Focus on systems                   |
| Trust without verification   | Verify at each phase               |
| Problems hidden by tile      | Problems addressed early           |
| No documentation             | Photo & inspection documentation   |

> **The best projects are the ones where nothing has to be explained after the fact.**
