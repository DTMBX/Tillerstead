# NJ Codes, Permits & Inspections

## Step 1 of the Construction Order — New Jersey Bathroom & Shower Projects

This page explains **how bathroom and shower construction is regulated in New Jersey**, what permits and inspections actually do, and why skipping them creates risk—not savings.

This is the starting point for any compliant build.

## The Governing System: New Jersey Uniform Construction Code (UCC)

All construction in New Jersey is regulated under the **Uniform Construction Code (UCC)** (N.J.A.C. 5:23).

Key characteristics:

* Statewide code framework
* Local enforcement
* Model codes adopted by reference
* Inspector discretion allowed within defined limits

The UCC adopts national model codes, including:

* **International Residential Code (IRC)** — residential construction
* **International Plumbing Code (IPC)** — plumbing systems
* **International Mechanical & Electrical Codes** — ventilation, wiring, controls

> Inspectors enforce the **intent of the code**: safety, sanitation, drainage, and durability.

---

## Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)

The **Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)** is the local Construction Office or Construction Official assigned to your municipality.

The AHJ:

* Reviews permit applications
* Conducts inspections
* Interprets the UCC locally
* Approves or rejects alternative methods

Important realities:

* Two towns may interpret details slightly differently
* Inspectors do not approve brand names—they approve performance
* Early communication avoids late rework

---

## When a Permit Is Required

A permit is typically required when a bathroom or shower project includes:

* New or relocated plumbing
* Drain or vent modifications
* Shower or tub replacement
* Waterproofing system replacement
* Structural or framing changes
* Electrical work (lighting, outlets, heated floors)

Purely cosmetic work *may* be exempt, but waterproofing and drain work almost always trigger permitting.

> Permits protect both the homeowner and the contractor.

---

## What Permits Actually Do (Plain Language)

A permit:

* Establishes a legal scope of work
* Requires inspections at critical stages
* Creates a record of compliant construction

A permit does **not**:

* Guarantee quality finishes
* Dictate tile brand or layout
* Replace contractor skill

It ensures the work meets **minimum life-safety and sanitation standards**.

---

## Typical Inspection Sequence

While details vary by municipality, most bathroom and shower builds follow this order:

1. **Rough Plumbing Inspection**
   Drain location, slope intent, venting, supply lines

2. **Rough Framing / Construction Inspection**
   Structural changes, blocking, benches, niches

3. **Shower Pan / Waterproofing Inspection** (where required)
   Slope, drain integration, water containment

4. **Final Inspection**
   Fixtures installed, systems operational

Some inspectors require flood testing documentation; others visually verify waterproofing assemblies.

---

## Why Inspectors Focus on What They Do

Inspectors focus on items that:

* Cannot be corrected after tile
* Affect sanitation and moisture control
* Create long-term liability if missed

They are not evaluating aesthetics. They are verifying **assemblies**.

---

## Approved Alternatives & Performance-Based Approval

The UCC allows inspectors to approve alternative methods when:

* The intent of the code is satisfied
* Performance is equal or superior
* The system is coherent and documented

This is why mixing incompatible systems often fails inspection—performance cannot be verified.

---

## Common Misunderstandings

* “It passed inspection before, so it must be fine”
  → Past approvals do not override current code

* “Tile standards are code”
  → Tile standards guide best practice; inspectors enforce code

* “Curbless means no rules”
  → Curbless showers are performance-based, not exempt

---

## What Homeowners Should Ask Up Front

* Is a permit required for this scope?
* Will the shower pan or waterproofing be inspected?
* Are flood tests expected or recommended?
* Are there local interpretations affecting curbless showers?

Clear answers early prevent delays and redesigns later.

---

## Key Takeaways

* New Jersey uses a **statewide code with local enforcement**
* Permits establish scope and inspection checkpoints
* Inspectors verify function and safety, not appearance
* Early coordination reduces cost and risk

## Next Step in the Build Phase

**Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains**
How water is managed before tile is installed—and why most failures start here.
