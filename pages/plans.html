hero_title: Simple, Preventive Maintenance—Handled Personally
hero_summary: >-
  I'm a one-man contractor. That's the point: you get the same person every
  visit—consistent eyes on your home, honest prioritization, and small issues
  handled before they become expensive problems. Plans are flexible, scope is
  written, and every visit is documented with notes and photos.

      Most “emergencies” aren’t surprises—they’re small problems that went
      unseen too long. A maintenance plan keeps you ahead of leaks, rot, loose
      fixtures, grout failures, caulk breakdown, and seasonal wear.

      <strong>Good fit for:</strong> homeowners who want a reliable person to
      keep the property stable—without chasing contractors for every small fix.

    <ol class="ts-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Baseline walk-through:</strong> we identify priority items,

        <strong>Written plan:</strong> you get a simple scope and visit cadence
        (monthly / quarterly / seasonal).

      <li>
        <strong>Visits + documentation:</strong> each visit includes notes,
        photos, and clear “now vs later” recommendations.

      <li>
        <strong>Small repairs handled:</strong> minor fixes are addressed
        on-site when possible; larger work is quoted separately.
