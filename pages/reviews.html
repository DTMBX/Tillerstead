            <strong>No rewriting:</strong> We do not edit wording or change
            meaning. Formatting only.

            <strong>Process documentation:</strong> Where appropriate
            (especially tile and wet areas), we document key phases so clients
            understand what was built before it’s covered.

          Reviews describe individual customer experiences. Results and
