- question: "Do you build full shower waterproofing systems or just tile?"
  answer: 'We build complete wet-area assemblies—prep, waterproofing, drains/transitions, then tile—so performance isn''t dependent on "surface fixes."'

- question: "Do you do flood testing?"
  answer: "When the project scope and site conditions allow, flood testing is used to verify the pan/assembly before tile goes in."

- question: "What areas do you serve?"
  answer: "Primary service area: Atlantic, Ocean, and Cape May Counties. If you're nearby, reach out and we'll confirm availability."

- question: "Why does the Build Phase matter?"
  answer: "Most bathroom failures result from missed decisions early in construction—not tile or fixture choice. The Build Phase ensures proper sequencing and verification before finishes conceal the work."

- question: "Can you explain your warranty?"
  answer: "We provide a 2-year workmanship warranty on all installations. This covers our labor; manufacturer warranties on materials are separate. Details available upon request."

- question: "Are you licensed in New Jersey?"
  answer: "Yes. We are licensed as a New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor (HIC #13VH10808800) and carry liability insurance. You have a 3-day rescission right on any contract."
