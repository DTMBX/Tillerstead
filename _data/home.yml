    Beautiful finishes start with the invisible work: flat substrates, correct materials,
    and a waterproofing system built as a complete assembly. We follow published
    tile industry methods and manufacturer requirements—so your bathroom performs
    long after the final photo.

  title: "Tile & Waterproofing Services That Hold Up"
  summary: >
    Tile performs when the assembly is built correctly: proper substrate preparation,
    compatible mortars, verified coverage, movement accommodation, and waterproofing
    where the application demands it. We build to published industry methods and
    product specifications—not guesswork.
  homeowner_note: >
    You don’t need to speak “construction” to hire well. We explain the plan in plain language,
    provide a written scope, and document critical steps so you know what’s behind the finish.

      title: "Natural Stone & Large-Format Tile"
      description: >
        Stone and large-format tile require tighter tolerances, stronger support, and careful planning.
        We build the substrate and setting system to match the material—not the other way around.
      details:
        - "Flatness and substrate readiness addressed for large-format requirements"
        - "Setting methods selected to support full contact and long-term stability"
        - "Materials matched to stone type and manufacturer specifications"
        - "Sealers used where appropriate, based on product data and application"
        - "Heat, sunlight, and transitions considered in the plan"

      title: "Shower Waterproofing Systems"
      description: >
        Wet areas are built as waterproofing assemblies first—then tiled. We use membranes and system components
        appropriate to the application, detailed at corners, penetrations, and drains, and verified before finishes.
      details:
        - "Membrane and drain integration planned as one coherent system"
        - "Corners, seams, niches, curbs, and penetrations detailed per system requirements"
        - "Slope and drainage confirmed before tile installation"
        - "Flood testing performed where required or method-appropriate (documented)"
        - "Closeout guidance provided for care and long-term maintenance"

  eyebrow: "A Clear Sequence You Can Understand"
  title: "Transparent Workflow, Written Scope, Verified Steps"
  summary: >
    A bathroom remodel runs smoothly when decisions are made early and the build follows a defined order.
    We keep scope clear, document key phases, and confirm readiness before moving forward.
  fun_fact: >
    Many failures originate before the first tile is installed. That’s why we focus on substrate readiness,
    water management, and verification before finishes conceal the work.
