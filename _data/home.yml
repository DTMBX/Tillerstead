  title: "Why Tile? Because It's the Only Finish That Gets Better With Age"
  summary: "Tile isn't trendy—it's timeless. It survived the Romans, it'll survive your kids. But only if it's installed with the right substrate prep, waterproofing, and mortar coverage. That's where I come in: licensed, obsessed, and slightly nerdy about deflection limits."
  real_talk: "Real Talk: I measure substrates with a level, not my eyes. I flood-test waterproofing because hoping it doesn't leak isn't a strategy. And yes, I take 47+ photos per project—because if you're investing this much, you deserve proof it was done right."

      title: "Tile That Actually Lasts (Not Just Looks Good)"
      description: "Porcelain, ceramic, natural stone—I install them all with TCNA precision. But here's what makes me different: I don't just stick tile to walls. I engineer the substrate, waterproof to ANSI standards, and ensure 95% mortar coverage on every large-format tile. Why? Because I've seen too many 'pretty' installations fail in 2 years."
      details:
        - "Showers that survive flood tests—not just pass inspections on paper"
        - "Heated floors with verified thermal coverage (no cold spots, ever)"
        - "Large-format tile (≥15\") set with full coverage—the way manufacturers intended"

I treat them that way: book-matched for seamless veining, sealed with penetrating sealers (not that cheap topical junk that yellows), and set with the correct thinset because yes, stone is picky about its mortar."
      details:
        - "Book-matched marble where the veining flows like it's one piece"
        - "6mm porcelain slabs set to manufacturer specs (not 'close enough')"

I use Schluter KERDI, Laticrete Hydroban, and RedGard—installed per manufacturer specs, flood-tested with actual water, and photo-documented before tile. Why? Because 'trust me, it's waterproof' isn't good enough when it's your shower."

  summary: "I don't ghost you after the estimate. I don't surprise you with change orders. And I definitely don't 'eyeball' substrate flatness. Here's exactly how I work—from that first walk-through to the final grout line."
  fun_fact: "Fun Fact: I once re-did an entire shower pan because the slope was 1/16\" off spec. Most contractors wouldn't notice. I couldn't sleep knowing it might pool water in 5 years. Yeah, I'm that guy."

I'm licensed (NJ HIC #13VH10808800), I'm honest, and I'll tell you if your framing can't handle large-format tile before we start—not after."

  summary: "Materials matter. Not because I'm picky (okay, I'm picky), but because the right mortar, membrane, and grout can add 20 years to your installation. The wrong ones? You're calling me back in 3 years wondering why everything's cracking."
  callout: "Real Talk: That 'waterproof' RedGard from Home Depot? It's great—if you apply it correctly, at the right thickness, over proper substrate prep. Most DIYers don't. That's why I exist."
