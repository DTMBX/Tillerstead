    governs: "Waterproof membrane performance for tile installations"
    publisher: "ANSI/TCA"
    official_source: "https://tcnatile.com/ansi/"
    requirements:
      - "Membrane must support tile weight without delamination"
      - "Must remain waterproof under typical service conditions"
    notes: >
      Products claiming ANSI A118.10 compliance have been tested for waterproofing.
      Both liquid and sheet membranes can meet this standard.

    requirements:
      - "Must isolate tiles from in-plane substrate cracks up to 1/8\" (3mm)"
    notes: >
      Many waterproofing membranes also meet crack isolation requirements.
      RedGard, AquaDefense, and Hydro Ban meet both A118.10 and A118.12.

# HOW STANDARDS ARE USED IN CALCULATORS
# ============================================
calculator_compliance_notes:
  mortar_calculator: >
    Trowel selection follows TCNA recommendations based on tile size.
    Coverage requirements per ANSI A108: minimum 80% dry areas, 95% wet areas.
    Back-buttering recommended per TCNA for large-format tile.
  
  grout_calculator: >
    Joint width recommendations per TCNA: minimum 3× tile facial variation.
    Sanded vs. unsanded guidance from TCNA FAQ.
    Formula is mathematical (joint volume calculation), not standard-mandated.
  
  waterproofing_calculator: >
    Products listed claim ANSI A118.10 and/or A118.12 compliance.
    Coverage rates from manufacturer TDS, not from ANSI standard.
    ANSI standard defines performance, not coverage rates.
  
  slope_calculator: >
    Minimum slope from IPC Section 417.5.2 (1/4\" per foot).
    Recommended slope (5/16\" per foot) is industry best practice, not code.
    Local codes may vary - verify with local jurisdiction.
