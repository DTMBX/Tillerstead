## Trust, But Verify

Waterproofing looks good? Great. But the only way to **know** it works is to test it—before tile goes on.

Once tile is installed, you can't fix waterproofing without tearing everything out.

## When Flood Testing Is Required

### TCNA Requirements

**Mortar bed shower pans:**  
Flood testing is **required** (TCNA Handbook method B421)

**Bonded waterproofing membranes over solid substrate:**  
Flood testing is **recommended** but not always required

### Local Code Variations

Some New Jersey municipalities require flood testing for all shower installations. Always verify with your local building inspector.

## How to Flood Test (TCNA Method B421)

### Materials Needed

- Drain plug or test balloon
- Hose or buckets
- Marker or tape
- Camera (for documentation)
- 24-48 hours of patience

### Step-by-Step

1. **Plug the drain**  
   Use a test balloon or watertight plug

2. **Fill the shower pan**  
   Fill to the height of the curb or drain threshold (typically 2-4 inches)

3. **Mark the water level**  
   Use tape or marker on the shower wall

4. **Photograph everything**  
   - Water level mark
   - Overall pan
   - Drain area
   - Curb/threshold

5. **Wait 24-48 hours**  
   Do not disturb. No one uses the bathroom during this time.

6. **Check water level**  
   - No drop = PASS ✅
   - Any drop = FAIL ❌

7. **Document results**  
   Photograph final water level

### Acceptable Results

**PASS:** Water level remains constant (within 1/8")

Minor evaporation is normal in dry climates, but level should not drop significantly.

**FAIL:** Water level drops more than 1/8"

This indicates a leak. Do not proceed with tile installation.

## What to Do If It Fails

1. **Drain the pan completely**
2. **Allow to dry** (24-48 hours)
3. **Locate the leak:**
   - Inspect drain connection
   - Check corners and seams
   - Look for punctures or gaps in membrane
4. **Repair per manufacturer instructions**
5. **Re-test**

Do not skip re-testing. A "patch job" without verification is guesswork.

## Bonded Membrane Systems (Kerdi, RedGard, etc.)

Flood testing bonded membranes over solid substrate (cement board, foam board) is less common because:
- Membrane is bonded (no water path between layers)
- Drain integration is mechanical (clamping ring)
- System is designed to be waterproof when installed correctly

**However:** Testing is still recommended, especially:
- First time using a system
- Complex drain/niche details
- Homeowner requests verification
- Local code requires it

## Visual Inspection (If Not Flood Testing)

At minimum, **visually inspect** before tiling:

✅ All corners reinforced  
✅ Drain properly integrated  
✅ No gaps or voids in membrane  
✅ Seams overlapped per manufacturer specs  
✅ Penetrations sealed  
✅ Curb fully wrapped

**Photograph everything.** This is your insurance policy.

## Documentation

### What to Record

- Date of test
- Products used (membrane, drain, etc.)
- Initial water level (photo + measurement)
- Final water level (photo + measurement)
- Duration of test (24 or 48 hours)
- Pass/fail result

### Why This Matters

- **Warranty claims:** Manufacturers may require proof of testing
- **Insurance claims:** Documentation of proper installation
- **Resale value:** Shows quality workmanship
- **Peace of mind:** You know it works

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Testing too short** (< 24 hours doesn't prove anything)  
❌ **Not marking water level** (can't tell if it dropped)  
❌ **Proceeding after failed test** (hoping it "seals itself")  
❌ **No documentation** (no proof test was performed)  
❌ **Testing after tile installation** (too late)

## Final Verification Checklist

Before tiling begins:

✅ Flood test performed (or visual inspection documented)  
✅ Test results photographed  
✅ All corners, seams, drains verified  
✅ No gaps or voids in waterproofing  
✅ Slope verified (1/4" per foot minimum)  
✅ Substrate flatness checked

If all boxes are checked → proceed with confidence.
