## The Foundation of a Leak-Free Shower

A properly sloped shower pan ensures water flows toward the drain—not pooling on the floor or seeping into walls. This isn't optional; it's required by TCNA standards and building codes.

## TCNA Slope Requirements

**Minimum slope:** 1/4" per foot (2% grade) toward the drain

This means for every 12 inches away from the drain, the floor must drop by at least 1/4 inch.

### Why This Matters

- **Prevents standing water** (mold, mildew, bacteria growth)
- **Ensures proper drainage** (no pooling after showers)
- **Extends tile life** (reduces efflorescence and grout deterioration)

## Shower Pan Construction Methods

### Pre-Sloped Foam Pans

Lightweight, pre-formed foam pans with built-in slope. Popular for curbless and standard showers.

**Pros:** Consistent slope, lightweight, easy to cut  
**Cons:** Requires proper substrate preparation

### Mortar Bed Pans

Traditional method using deck mud (sand/cement mix) troweled to slope.

**Pros:** Fully customizable, proven method  
**Cons:** Labor-intensive, requires skilled tradesman, heavier

### Bonded Mortar Over Pre-Slope

Hybrid method: pre-sloped base with thin mortar overlay for fine-tuning.

## Drain Types

### Center Drain

Most common. Water flows from all sides toward the center.

**Slope:** Uniform in all directions

### Linear Drain

Rectangular drain, often used in curbless showers.

**Slope:** Two-way (toward the drain channel)

### Point Drain (Offset)

Drain located off-center or in corner.

**Slope:** Requires careful planning to avoid flat spots

## Verification Before Waterproofing

Before any waterproofing membrane goes down:

✅ Verify slope with level (minimum 1/4" per foot)  
✅ Check for low spots or flat areas  
✅ Confirm drain is seated properly and level  
✅ Test-fit drain grate for proper clearance

## Common Failures

❌ **Flat spots** where water pools  
❌ **Reverse slope** (slopes away from drain)  
❌ **Drain not level** with shower floor  
❌ **Inadequate slope** (<1/4" per foot)
