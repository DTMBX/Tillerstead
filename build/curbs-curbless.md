# Curbs, Curbless Showers & Thresholds

## Step 4 of the Construction Order — Containing Water at the Entry

This page explains **why shower curbs exist**, how curbless showers are permitted in New Jersey, and what inspectors are evaluating when reviewing thresholds and transitions.

This guide follows [**TCNA Handbook**](https://www.tcnatile.com/products/handbook.html) threshold design methods for curbless configurations and curb detailing.

Curbs are not decorative. They are a water-containment device.

## The Code Intent (Plain Language)

> **The shower entry must prevent water from leaving the wet area under normal use and during temporary drain restriction.**

Whether achieved with a curb or a curbless design, the goal is the same: **containment and control**.

---

## Curbed Showers (Traditional Thresholds)

When a shower includes a curb, model plumbing codes adopted by New Jersey typically expect:

* A finished curb height **at least 2 inches above the drain**
* A curb that is not excessively wide or unsafe
* Waterproofing that fully wraps the curb

### What "2 Inches Above the Drain" Actually Means

| Measurement | Reference Point |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Start** | Top of the drain grate (finished) |
| **End** | Top of the curb (finished tile surface) |
| **Minimum** | 2 inches |

This is **not** measured from the bathroom floor. It applies only when a curb is present.

This requirement addresses splash-out and overflow risk.

### Curb Construction Requirements

Per [TCNA guidelines](https://www.tcnatile.com/products/handbook.html):

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Solid framing or masonry (not foam alone) |
| **Width** | Typically 3-4 inches minimum for stability |
| **Height** | 2" minimum above drain after tile |
| **Waterproofing** | Continuous from floor, up, over, and down curb |

### Waterproofing at Curbs

The curb is a critical transition point. Waterproofing must:

* Extend from the shower floor up the inside face
* Continue over the top of the curb
* Wrap down the outside face
* Maintain continuity at corners

**No fasteners should penetrate horizontal curb surfaces.**

---

## Curbless Showers (Zero-Threshold)

Curbless showers are **not prohibited** in New Jersey residential construction, but they are treated as **performance-based designs**.

### What This Means for Homeowners

| Curbed Shower | Curbless Shower |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Curb physically contains water | Design and drainage contain water |
| Prescriptive code compliance | Performance-based compliance |
| Standard approach | Requires additional planning |

> Removing the curb increases planning responsibility—it does not remove requirements.

---

## How Curbless Showers Achieve Water Containment

Instead of relying on a curb, water containment is achieved through:

| Strategy | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Floor elevation planning** | Shower floor lower than bathroom floor |
| **Extended slope** | Slope continues beyond wet area |
| **Strategic drain placement** | Linear drain at entry captures water |
| **Drain capacity** | Larger drain handles flow volume |

### Common Curbless Design Approaches

| Approach | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Recessed shower floor** | Shower floor dropped below bathroom level | Slab-on-grade, new construction |
| **Linear drain at entry** | Trench drain placed at threshold | Prevents water exit |
| **Full bathroom slope** | Entire floor slopes toward shower | Open bathroom designs |
| **Barrier-reduced** | Minor bevel vs. full curb | When full curbless isn't possible |

---

## NJ Inspector Expectations for Curbless Showers

Inspectors may accept curbless showers when they see:

| Element | Verification |
|---------|--------------|
| **Continuous slope** | Water directed inward to drain |
| **Adequate drainage** | Linear or appropriately-sized drain |
| **Extended waterproofing** | Membrane continues beyond wet area |
| **Planned water control** | Documented design intent |

### Coordination with Your AHJ

**Early coordination is strongly recommended.** Before finalizing a curbless design:

1. Contact your local Construction Office
2. Describe the proposed design
3. Ask about specific requirements or interpretations
4. Document the conversation
5. Submit for review with permit application

> **Pro tip:** Not all inspectors have extensive experience with curbless showers. Providing clear documentation of your design intent—including TCNA method references—can facilitate approval.

## Accessibility Standards: When They Apply

### ICC A117.1 Accessibility Standards

Accessibility standards apply **only when legally triggered**, such as:

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Accessible dwelling units** | Multi-family requirements |
| **Public accommodations** | Commercial bathrooms |
| **Fair Housing Act** | Covered multifamily buildings |
| **Voluntary compliance** | Aging-in-place planning |

### Standard Residential Remodels

Standard residential remodels are **not automatically subject** to accessibility requirements, even when curbless designs are chosen.

However, if you're planning for aging-in-place or future accessibility needs, consider:

* Blocking for future grab bars
* Wider doorways
* Reinforced bench locations
* Proper slope for wheelchair access

## Curbless Shower Construction: A Planning Framework

### Critical Planning Equations

For a true curbless (zero-threshold) shower:

| Calculation | Formula |
|-------------|---------|
| **Required drop** | Distance to drain (ft) × 0.25" |
| **Perimeter height** | Drain height + required drop |
| **Mortar bed thickness** | Varies from drain to perimeter |

### Example Calculation

For a shower with drain 4 feet from entry:
* Required drop: 4 ft × 0.25" = 1 inch
* Shower floor must be 1" lower at drain than at entry
* Entry must be flush with bathroom floor

### Step-by-Step Build Sequence

1. **Assess structure** — Determine if floor can be recessed
2. **Plan elevations** — Calculate all heights before starting
3. **Rough plumbing** — Set drain at correct height
4. **Framing adjustments** — Notch or lower as approved
5. **Subfloor prep** — Verify flatness and structural integrity
6. **Slope mortar bed** — Build to calculated elevations
7. **Waterproofing** — Extend beyond wet area minimum 12"
8. **Drain integration** — Match drain to membrane system
9. **Flood test** — Verify containment before tile
10. **Tile installation** — Maintain transitions to adjacent flooring

## Waterproofing at Thresholds

Regardless of curb type:

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Continuous across threshold** | Water can't escape at transition |
| **Proper termination** | Membrane must end correctly |
| **No fasteners through horizontal** | Penetrations create leak paths |

Thresholds must be treated as part of the waterproofing system, not as trim.

### Extended Waterproofing for Curbless

For curbless showers, waterproofing typically extends:

* **Minimum 12 inches** beyond the wet area
* Into the bathroom floor area
* With proper termination or transition

---

## Common Threshold Failure Points

| Failure | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Leaks at curb base** | Waterproofing stopped at floor | Wrap membrane up and over curb |
| **Curb corner failures** | Inadequate corner treatment | Pre-formed corners or reinforcement |
| **Curbless water escape** | Inadequate slope planning | Calculate elevations before construction |
| **Fastener penetrations** | Screws through curb cap | No horizontal fasteners |
| **Waterproofing stops at opening** | Membrane ends at shower edge | Extend beyond wet area |

---

## Questions Homeowners Should Ask

Before threshold design is finalized:

* Is a curbed or curbless design better for my space?
* What TCNA method will be used?
* How will water be contained without a curb?
* Has this design been discussed with the inspector?
* How will waterproofing be handled at the threshold?
* Will a flood test verify containment?

* Curbless showers rely on performance, not exemption from requirements
* Early AHJ coordination is essential for curbless designs
* Thresholds are part of the waterproofing system
* Planning prevents late rejection
