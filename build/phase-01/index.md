## Why Codes and Permits Matter

In New Jersey, bathroom remodeling isn't just about aesthetics—it's about safety, structural integrity, and legal compliance. Understanding what requires a permit and what doesn't can save you time, money, and headaches.

## What Requires a Permit in NJ?

Most structural, plumbing, and electrical work requires permits:

- **Moving or installing plumbing fixtures** (toilets, showers, tubs)
- **Electrical work** (new circuits, outlets, lighting)
- **Structural changes** (removing walls, altering floor joists)
- **HVAC modifications** (adding/relocating exhaust fans)

Simple cosmetic updates (paint, fixtures that don't require new rough-ins) typically don't require permits.

## New Jersey HIC Requirements

All contractors performing home improvement work in New Jersey must be registered with the Division of Consumer Affairs and hold a valid HIC (Home Improvement Contractor) license.

**Red flags:**
- Contractor offers to "skip the permit to save money"
- No HIC number provided
- Suggests work can be done "under the table"

## The Inspection Process

Bathroom remodels typically require inspections at these stages:

1. **Rough-in inspection** (framing, plumbing, electrical before walls are closed)
2. **Final inspection** (completed work verified for code compliance)

Some municipalities may require additional inspections for waterproofing or structural work.

## Standards Referenced

- **New Jersey Uniform Construction Code (NJUCC)**
- **International Residential Code (IRC)**
- **National Electrical Code (NEC)**
- **International Plumbing Code (IPC)**

## Key Takeaways

✅ Always verify your contractor is HIC-licensed  
✅ Obtain required permits before work begins  
✅ Schedule inspections as required by your municipality  
✅ Keep all permit documentation for future resale
