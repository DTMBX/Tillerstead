## Tile Is Only as Good as What's Beneath It

You can have the most beautiful tile in the world—but if it's installed over poor substrate, wrong mortar, or inadequate coverage, it **will** fail.

## TCNA & ANSI Standards

**TCNA Handbook:** The tile industry's definitive installation guide  
**ANSI A108 Series:** Workmanship standards for tile installation  
**ANSI A118 Series:** Material standards (thin-set, grout, waterproofing)

These aren't suggestions—they're engineered methods proven over decades.

## Substrate Preparation

### Flatness Requirements (TCNA/ANSI)

**For tiles < 15":**
- Maximum 1/4" variation in 10 feet
- Maximum 1/16" variation in 1 foot

**For tiles ≥ 15" (large-format):**
- Maximum 1/8" variation in 10 feet
- Maximum 1/16" variation in 2 feet

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents lippage (edges sticking up)
- Ensures full mortar contact
- Avoids cracked tiles

### Verification

Use a **straightedge** (6-10 ft) to check flatness before tiling.

Low spots? Fill with leveling compound.  
High spots? Grind down or use thicker mortar.

## Mortar Selection

Not all thin-set is created equal.

### Modified vs. Unmodified

**Modified thin-set:**
- Contains polymer additives
- Better bond strength, flexibility
- Use over cement board, drywall, plywood

**Unmodified thin-set:**
- No polymers
- Required with certain waterproofing membranes (check manufacturer specs)
- Allows vapor transmission

**Pro tip:** Always follow waterproofing manufacturer requirements. Some membranes require unmodified thin-set; using modified voids the warranty.

### Large-Format Mortar

Tiles ≥ 15" require:
- **Large & Heavy Tile (LHT) mortar**
- Higher polymer content
- Better sag resistance
- Improved bond strength

## Trowel Selection

Trowel size = mortar coverage.

**TCNA Guidelines:**

| Tile Size | Trowel Notch |
|-----------|--------------|
| < 8" | 1/4" x 1/4" square |
| 8-15" | 1/4" x 3/8" square or U-notch |
| 15-20" | 1/2" x 1/2" square |
| > 20" | 3/4" x 3/4" square or larger |

### Coverage Requirements

**Dry areas (walls, floors):** Minimum 80% coverage  
**Wet areas (showers, steam rooms):** Minimum 95% coverage

**How to verify:** Pull up a tile and check the back. You should see mortar ridges flattened across ≥95% of the tile.

## Back-Buttering

For large-format tile (≥12"), **back-butter** the tile:
1. Trowel mortar on substrate
2. Apply thin layer to back of tile
3. Set tile and beat in

This ensures 95%+ coverage and eliminates voids.

## Layout & Grout Joints

### Grout Joint Size

**Rectified tile (machine-cut edges):**
- Minimum 1/16" (tight joint)
- Typical: 1/8" to 3/16"

**Non-rectified tile:**
- Minimum 1/8"
- Typical: 3/16" to 1/4"

**Floor tile:**
- Minimum 1/8"
- Typical: 1/4" to 3/8"

### Layout Principles

✅ **Center layout:** Start from center of wall/floor, work outward  
✅ **Symmetry:** Balance cuts on both ends  
✅ **Avoid slivers:** No cuts < 1/3 tile width  
✅ **Plan transitions:** Where does tile meet other materials?

### Lippage Control

For large-format tile, use **leveling systems** (clips + wedges) to prevent lippage during curing.

## Grouting

### Grout Types

**Sanded grout:**
- For joints ≥ 1/8"
- Contains sand for strength
- Can scratch polished surfaces

**Unsanded grout:**
- For joints < 1/8"
- Smoother finish
- Used on polished marble, glass tile

**Epoxy grout:**
- Chemical-resistant
- Stain-proof
- Harder to work with, more expensive

### Grout Application

1. **Wait for mortar to cure** (24-48 hours minimum)
2. **Remove spacers**
3. **Clean joints** (no dust, debris, or mortar)
4. **Mix grout** (to toothpaste consistency)
5. **Apply at 45° angle** (pack joints fully)
6. **Remove excess** (diagonal passes)
7. **Sponge clean** (minimal water, frequent rinse)

### Sealing

**Grout sealer:**
- Apply after grout cures (7-10 days)
- Reapply annually for floor tile
- Not required for epoxy grout

**Stone/tile sealer:**
- Required for porous natural stone
- Follow manufacturer specs

## Common Failures

❌ **Inadequate mortar coverage** (hollows = cracks)  
❌ **Wrong trowel size** (too small = poor bond)  
❌ **Tiling over uneven substrate** (lippage, cracks)  
❌ **Using modified thin-set with membrane that requires unmodified** (bond failure)  
❌ **Grouting before mortar cures** (weak joints)
