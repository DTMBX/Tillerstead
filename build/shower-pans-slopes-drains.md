# Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains

## Step 2 of the Construction Order — Water Management Before Tile

This page explains **how showers actually manage water**, why slope and drain selection matter more than tile, and what New Jersey inspectors are looking for *before* waterproofing and finishes.

This guide follows [**TCNA Handbook**](https://www.tcnatile.com/products/handbook.html) guidance on pan design, pre-slope systems, and drainage—the foundation that prevents failure.

Most shower failures originate here.

## The Core Principle

> **Waterproofing and drainage must work before tile is installed.**

Tile and grout are finishes—not water control systems. Code compliance and long-term performance depend on what happens beneath them.

---

## Required Shower Slope (Non-Negotiable)

Under model plumbing codes adopted by New Jersey ([IPC Section 417.5.2](https://codes.iccsafe.org/)):

* Shower floors must slope a **minimum of 1/4 inch per foot** toward the drain
* The slope must be **continuous** and **uniform**
* Flat areas or reverse pitch are not acceptable

### Critical Clarification for Homeowners

The slope must exist in the **waterproofing layer**, not just in the tile surface.

| What Homeowners Often Think | What's Actually Required |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| "The tile is sloped" | The slope must be *under* the waterproofing |
| "Water finds its way to the drain" | Water must be *directed* by slope, not luck |
| "We can fix it with thinset" | Thinset cannot correct missing slope |

### Calculating Required Slope

| Distance to Drain | Required Drop |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 2 feet | 1/2 inch |
| 3 feet | 3/4 inch |
| 4 feet | 1 inch |
| 5 feet | 1-1/4 inches |

> **Homeowner insight:** If your contractor says they'll "slope it with thinset," that's a warning sign. Proper slope is built into the mortar bed or pre-sloped pan—not the tile layer.

---

## Drain Type Determines the System

Before a pan is built, the drain type must be selected. **Mixing drain types and waterproofing methods is a common cause of failure.**

### Understanding Drain Types (TCNA Methods)

| Drain Type | TCNA Method | How It Works | Best For |
|------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Bonded/Flanged** | B421 | Membrane bonds directly to drain flange | Modern showers, curbless designs |
| **Clamping (Traditional)** | B422 | Liner clamped between drain components | Traditional installations |
| **Linear/Trench** | B421 variants | Extended drain at wall or threshold | Curbless showers, modern design |

### Bonded (Surface-Applied) Drains — TCNA Method B421

Characteristics per [TCNA B421](https://www.tcnatile.com/):

* Waterproof membrane bonds directly to the drain flange
* The entire waterproofing layer is sloped
* Tile is installed directly on the membrane
* No saturated mortar bed beneath the waterproofing

**Typical use:**
* Modern showers
* Curbless designs
* Custom or pre-sloped pans

**Critical requirements:**
* Drain must be designed for bonded systems (matching flange)
* Membrane must achieve full contact with flange
* System must meet [ANSI A118.10](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html) for waterproof membranes

### Traditional Clamping Drains — TCNA Method B422

Characteristics per [TCNA B422](https://www.tcnatile.com/):

* Waterproof liner is clamped between drain components
* Requires a **pre-slope under the liner**
* Mortar bed is placed above the liner
* Weep holes must remain clear for drainage

**Critical risk homeowners should understand:**

* **Skipping the pre-slope traps water under the mortar bed**
* Water that doesn't reach the drain stays saturated
* This leads to odor, mold, and eventual system failure

> **Why this matters:** Traditional clamping drains require *two* slopes—one under the liner (pre-slope) and one above it (for the tile). Many contractors skip the pre-slope, causing failures years later.

## TCNA Shower Receptor Methods Explained

For homeowners who want to understand what their contractor should be doing:

### Method B421: Bonded Waterproof Membrane Shower Receptor

[TCNA Method B421](https://www.tcnatile.com/products/handbook.html) specifies:

1. Subfloor preparation and slope verification
2. Sloped mortar bed (deck mud) installation
3. Bonded waterproof membrane application
4. Membrane-to-drain integration
5. Tile installation directly on membrane

**This is the modern, preferred method for most residential showers.**

### Method B422: Traditional Membrane Shower Receptor

[TCNA Method B422](https://www.tcnatile.com/products/handbook.html) specifies:

1. **Pre-slope** mortar bed under the liner (1/4" per foot minimum)
2. Waterproof liner (PVC or CPE) installation
3. Liner clamped into drain body
4. Mortar bed over liner
5. Tile installation on mortar bed

**This method is still valid but requires more steps and is prone to execution errors.**

## Custom Sloped Pans vs. Pre-Formed Trays

Both approaches are permitted when properly executed.

### Site-Built (Custom) Sloped Pans

Used when:

* Drain is off-center
* Shower dimensions are non-standard
* Framing irregularities exist
* Precise plane control is required

**Key requirement per TCNA:**

* Constructed using **dry-pack deck mud** (sand:cement mix)
* Sloped uniformly to the drain
* Allowed to cure before waterproofing

### Pre-Formed Foam Trays (TCNA B415)

Used when:

* Shower size matches manufacturer dimensions
* Drain location is fixed
* Subfloor is flat and level

**Key limitation:**

* Trays cannot compensate for framing errors
* Must use manufacturer-specified drain and waterproofing

**Common pre-formed systems:**
* Schluter KERDI-SHOWER
* Laticrete Hydro Ban Board
* USG Durock

> **Homeowner note:** Pre-formed systems are excellent choices when properly installed—but they require strict adherence to manufacturer instructions and compatible components.

## Drain Height & Finished Floor Planning

Drain height must be set **before** the pan is built.

### What Proper Planning Accounts For:

| Layer | Typical Thickness |
|-------|-------------------|
| Mortar bed (at drain) | 1/2" minimum |
| Waterproof membrane | Varies by product |
| Thinset | 3/16" to 1/4" |
| Tile | 3/8" typical |
| **Total at drain** | 1" to 1-1/2" above subfloor |

The drain should finish **flush with or slightly below** the tile surface—never recessed or crowned.

---

## NJ Inspection Expectations at the Pan Stage

What inspectors may verify before you proceed:

| Inspection Point | What They're Looking For |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Drain type | Matches permitted scope |
| Slope verification | 1/4" per foot minimum toward drain |
| Waterproofing continuity | No gaps, proper overlap |
| System compatibility | Drain, membrane, and mortar work together |
| Pre-slope (if traditional) | Slope exists *under* the liner |

Some municipalities require a dedicated pan or waterproofing inspection before tile. Ask your contractor to confirm this with your local AHJ.

---

## Questions Homeowners Should Ask

Before your shower pan is built:

* What drain type are you using?
* What TCNA method does this follow?
* Is the waterproofing ANSI A118.10 compliant?
* Will there be a pre-slope (if traditional method)?
* Will the inspector see this before tile?
* Can I see the slope verified with a level?

---

## Common Failure Points (What to Avoid)

| Failure | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Standing water | Flat or inconsistent slope | Build slope into mortar bed |
| Drain leaks | Incompatible drain/membrane | Match drain to waterproofing system |
| Trapped water under tile | Missing pre-slope (traditional) | Always pre-slope under liner |
| Drain too high or low | Poor planning | Calculate finished heights before building |
| Slope "fixed" with thinset | Improper technique | Slope must be in substrate, not thinset |

Once tile is installed, these issues are difficult or impossible to correct.
