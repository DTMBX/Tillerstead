# Tile Installation & Coverage Standards

## Step 6 of the Construction Order — Bonding the Finish to the System

Tile installation is the **final visible phase** of a bathroom or shower build—but its performance is determined entirely by the work completed before it. Tile does not correct structural issues, slope errors, or waterproofing defects. It reveals them.

This guide explains [**TCNA Handbook**](https://www.tcnatile.com/products/handbook.html) and [**ANSI A108/A118**](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html) standards for substrate preparation, mortar selection, coverage verification, and movement accommodation per **EJ171** guidelines—the practices that work together to produce durable tile installations that perform long after inspections are complete.

This is where builders prove they understand tile as a system, not a surface.

## The Core Principle

> **Tile is a finish bonded to a system—not a standalone surface.**

When tile fails, the cause is almost never the tile itself. Failures are rooted in inadequate preparation, incompatible materials, or insufficient coverage during installation.

Inspectors may not measure coverage or review layout decisions, but professional standards require these factors to be addressed *even when they are not directly inspected*.

---

## Substrate Readiness (Before Tile Begins)

Before tile installation starts, all substrates must be:

* Structurally sound and fully fastened
* Compatible with the selected waterproofing system
* Clean, dry, and free of contaminants
* **Flat within tile industry tolerances**

### Flatness Requirements per ANSI A108.02

| Tile Size | Maximum Allowable Variation |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Under 15"** | 1/4" in 10 feet |
| **15" and larger** | 1/8" in 10 feet |

### Flat vs. Level (A Critical Distinction for Homeowners)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Level** | Refers to gravity—horizontal alignment |
| **Flat** | Refers to plane—surface uniformity |

Tile assemblies require **flatness**, not level. A properly sloped shower floor can be fully code-compliant and perfectly flat at the same time.

> **Homeowner insight:** Attempting to correct flatness or slope with thinset during tile installation is a common cause of failure. If the substrate isn't flat, tile installation cannot fix it.

## ANSI Mortar Standards Explained

### Understanding Mortar Types

| Standard | Common Name | Description | Best Used For |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| [**ANSI A118.1**](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html) | Dry-set (unmodified) | Basic portland cement mortar | Dry areas, absorptive tiles |
| [**ANSI A118.4**](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html) | Modified (polymer-modified) | Enhanced bond and flexibility | Wet areas, exterior, large tiles |
| [**ANSI A118.15**](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html) | Improved modified | Higher performance version | Most demanding installations |
| [**ANSI A118.11**](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html) | Epoxy | Two-component chemical cure | Chemical resistance, food service |

### Mortar Selection for Bathroom/Shower Projects

For wet areas and waterproof membrane installations, **ANSI A118.4 or A118.15 mortars are typically required**.

Mortar must be selected based on:

* Tile size and material (porcelain, stone, glass)
* Substrate type (cement board, waterproof membrane)
* Waterproofing system requirements (bonding to membrane)
* Environmental conditions (wet area vs. dry area)

> **Key question for your contractor:** "What mortar are you using, and is it appropriate for the waterproofing membrane?"

---

## Coverage Requirements per ANSI A108.5

Adequate mortar coverage ensures:

* Full tile support across the entire back
* Even load distribution under foot traffic
* Reduced cracking and hollow spots
* Long-term durability in wet environments

### Coverage Requirements

| Installation Type | Minimum Coverage |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **Wet areas** | 95% coverage |
| **Dry interior** | 80% coverage |
| **Exterior** | 95% coverage |
| **Large format (any edge >15")** | 95% coverage |

### How Coverage is Verified

Coverage is **verified during installation** by periodically lifting tiles—not assumed after grouting.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Lift and inspect** | Remove tile after setting, check mortar contact |
| **Visual inspection** | Look for complete wet-out on tile back |
| **Tap test** | Sound changes indicate hollow areas (less reliable) |

---

## Trowel Selection & Installation Technique

Correct trowel selection per [TCNA guidelines](https://www.tcnatile.com/) depends on:

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Tile size** | Larger tiles need deeper trowel notches |
| **Tile back texture** | Textured backs may need larger notches |
| **Substrate flatness** | Flatter substrates allow smaller notches |

### TCNA Trowel Recommendations

| Tile Size | Trowel Notch (Square Notch) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Mosaic to 4x4** | 3/16" x 3/16" |
| **4x4 to 8x8** | 1/4" x 1/4" |
| **8x8 to 12x12** | 1/4" x 3/8" |
| **12x12 to 16x16** | 1/2" x 1/2" |
| **Larger than 16"** | 1/2" x 1/2" minimum, often larger |

### Best Practices per ANSI A108

* **Directional troweling** — Comb ridges in one direction
* **Back-buttering** — Apply mortar to tile back for large tiles
* **Collapse ridges** — Tile set should collapse trowel ridges fully
* **Coverage checks** — Lift tiles periodically during installation

---

## Large-Format Tile Considerations

Large-format tile (any edge 15" or longer) increases sensitivity to:

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Substrate flatness** | Lippage is magnified |
| **Mortar selection** | Must support greater weight |
| **Coverage discipline** | Voids cause cracking |
| **Installation sequencing** | More time-sensitive |

### Additional Requirements for Large Format

Per [ANSI A108.02](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html):

* Substrate flatness: **1/8" in 10 feet maximum**
* Coverage: **95% minimum**
* Back-buttering: **Required** in addition to substrate troweling
* Leveling systems: **Recommended** but don't replace proper prep

> **Homeowner note:** Mechanical leveling systems (clips and wedges) assist with alignment but **do not correct poor preparation** or inadequate coverage.

## Movement Accommodation — TCNA EJ171

Tile assemblies must accommodate movement to prevent cracking and debonding.

### Why Movement Joints Matter

Buildings move due to:
* Thermal expansion/contraction
* Moisture changes
* Structural deflection
* Seismic activity

Rigid grout or mortar at movement locations transfers stress into the tile assembly and leads to failure.

### Where Movement Joints Are Required

Per [TCNA EJ171](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/movement-joints-background.html):

| Location | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Changes of plane** | Wall-to-wall, wall-to-floor corners |
| **Perimeter conditions** | Where tile meets other materials |
| **Interior field joints** | Maximum 20-25 feet in each direction |
| **Structural joints** | Always honor building expansion joints |
| **Restraining surfaces** | Where tile abuts cabinets, fixtures |

### Soft Joints vs. Grout Joints

| Joint Type | Material | Used At |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **Soft joint** | Silicone or urethane sealant | Movement locations |
| **Grout joint** | Cementitious or epoxy grout | Tile-to-tile field joints |

> **Critical for homeowners:** If you see grout (not sealant) in corners or where tile meets the tub, that's a potential failure point. These should be soft joints filled with flexible sealant.

## What Inspectors Do—and Do Not—Review

In typical residential projects:

### Inspectors DO NOT:
* Evaluate tile layout or aesthetics
* Measure mortar coverage
* Assess grout joint consistency
* Check trowel notch selection

### Inspectors DO expect:
* Safe workmanship
* Verified waterproofing before tile
* Systems installed as permitted

**Professional standards fill the gap** between minimum inspection and long-term performance.

---

## Questions Homeowners Should Ask

Before tile installation begins:

* What mortar type are you using?
* Is it compatible with the waterproofing membrane?
* How will you verify coverage on large tiles?
* Where will movement joints be placed?
* What grout type (sanded, unsanded, epoxy)?
* What sealant for corners and perimeters?

---

## Common Tile Installation Failures

| Failure | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Hollow tiles** | Insufficient coverage | Proper trowel, coverage checks |
| **Cracked grout** | Movement at rigid joints | Soft joints per EJ171 |
| **Lippage** | Poor substrate flatness | Prep substrate to ANSI specs |
| **Debonding** | Incompatible mortar | Match mortar to substrate |
| **Stained grout** | Wrong grout type | Appropriate grout selection |

These failures often appear months after completion—well after inspections have passed.
