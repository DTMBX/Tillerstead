# Common Failures & Red Flags

## Step 8 of the Construction Order — How Problems Start, and How They're Prevented

This page ties the entire Build Phase together by explaining **where bathroom and shower failures actually originate**, what warning signs homeowners can recognize early, and why shortcuts nearly always cost more later.

This guide uses [**TCNA Handbook**](https://www.tcnatile.com/products/handbook.html) analysis of failure modes to show how each Build Phase step prevents predictable problems.

Most failures are not sudden. They are the predictable result of decisions made—or skipped—earlier in the build.

---

## The Core Reality

> **Nearly every shower failure can be traced to something that happened before tile was installed.**

Tile, grout, and sealant are often blamed because they are visible. The real causes are usually hidden beneath finished surfaces.

---

## Understanding Failure Patterns

### How TCNA Classifies Failures

The [TCNA Handbook](https://www.tcnatile.com/products/handbook.html) identifies common failure modes in tile installations:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Substrate failures** | Movement, deflection, moisture |
| **Installation failures** | Coverage, compatibility, technique |
| **System failures** | Incompatible components, missing elements |
| **Design failures** | Improper planning, specification errors |

Understanding these categories helps homeowners ask better questions before problems occur.

---

## Failure Pattern 1: Skipped or Rushed Planning

### What It Looks Like

* Drain type chosen late or changed mid-project
* Curbless decisions made after framing
* Bench or niche added "while we're at it"
* No clear scope document before demo

### Why It Fails

| Planning Failure | Consequence |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Drain chosen late** | Waterproofing system incompatible |
| **Curbless decided mid-build** | Floor elevations can't be corrected |
| **Additions mid-project** | Framing and waterproofing compromised |
| **No scope document** | Disagreements, change orders, errors |

### Prevention (Per TCNA Guidelines)

* Lock drain, curb/curbless, and waterproofing decisions **before demo**
* Document scope in writing with contractor
* Confirm all decisions with AHJ before work begins

> **Red flag phrase:** "We'll figure it out as we go."

---

## Failure Pattern 2: Improper Slope

### What It Looks Like

* Standing water after use (even a thin film)
* Dark grout lines near the drain
* Odor or slow drying
* Water pooling away from drain

### Why It Fails

| Slope Error | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| **Flat substrate** | Water doesn't reach drain |
| **Reverse pitch** | Water pools at walls |
| **Inconsistent slope** | Low spots collect water |
| **Slope "fixed" with thinset** | Temporary, fails over time |

### Prevention (Per IPC/TCNA)

* Minimum **1/4" per foot slope** built into mortar bed
* Slope verified with level before waterproofing
* Slope must be in waterproofing layer, not tile surface

> **Red flag phrase:** "We'll slope it with thinset."

---

## Failure Pattern 3: Incompatible Systems

### What It Looks Like

* Inspector rejection at waterproofing stage
* Leaks that appear at drain area
* Membrane pulling away from drain

### Why It Fails

| Incompatibility | Problem Created |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Surface membrane + clamping drain** | No proper connection point |
| **Mixed manufacturer systems** | Untested performance |
| **Liquid + sheet without approval** | Seam failure risk |

### Prevention (Per TCNA B421/B422)

* One coherent system from drain to walls
* Match drain type to waterproofing method
* Use manufacturer-approved compatible components

> **Red flag phrase:** "I've mixed these products before with no problems."

---

## Failure Pattern 4: Framing Movement

### What It Looks Like

* Cracked grout at benches or niches
* Tile separation at corners
* Gaps appearing over time
* Hollow-sounding areas

### Why It Fails

Per [ANSI A108.01](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html), tile installations have specific deflection limits:

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Floor substrate** | L/360 deflection limit for ceramic tile |
| **Wall substrate** | Properly attached, no movement between members |
| **Benches** | Fully supported, not cantilevered |
| **Niches** | Framed with headers if needed |

### Prevention

* Treat benches and niches as **structural elements**
* Verify blocking before waterproofing
* Confirm deflection limits are met for flooring

> **Red flag phrase:** "The tile will hold it together."

---

## Failure Pattern 5: Waterproofing Gaps

### What It Looks Like

* Leaks appearing outside the shower
* Water damage weeks or months after completion
* Staining on ceilings below
* Mold or mildew at unexpected locations

### Why It Fails

| Waterproofing Gap | Entry Point for Water |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Stops short at transitions** | Water enters at curb base |
| **Unsealed penetrations** | Water enters at pipes |
| **Fasteners through horizontal** | Direct path through membrane |
| **Insufficient overlap** | Seam separation over time |

### Prevention (Per TCNA Methods)

* Continuous, inspectable waterproofing before tile
* All penetrations sealed per manufacturer specs
* No fasteners through horizontal waterproofing surfaces
* Minimum 2" overlap at seams (verify per product)

> **Red flag phrase:** "It only needs waterproofing in the wet areas."

---

## Failure Pattern 6: Insufficient Tile Coverage

### What It Looks Like

* Hollow-sounding tiles when tapped
* Cracked tile corners
* Tiles that loosen over time
* Grout cracking in specific areas

### Why It Fails

Per [ANSI A108.5](https://www.tcnatile.com/faqs/ansi-standards.html):

| Coverage Error | Consequence |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Voids under tile** | No support = cracking |
| **Wrong trowel size** | Insufficient mortar contact |
| **No back-buttering (large tile)** | Edge support missing |
| **No coverage verification** | Problems hidden until failure |

### Prevention

* **95% minimum coverage** in wet areas
* Coverage checks during installation (lift and inspect)
* Proper trowel selection per TCNA guidelines
* Back-buttering for tiles 15" and larger

> **Red flag phrase:** "You don't need to back-butter—that's overkill."

---

## Failure Pattern 7: Skipping Verification

### What It Looks Like

* No flood test performed
* No documentation or inspection record
* No photos of pre-tile conditions
* Leaks discovered only after move-in

### Why It Fails

| Skipped Verification | Risk Created |
|---------------------|--------------|
| **No flood test** | Waterproofing failure hidden |
| **No inspection record** | No proof of compliant work |
| **No photos** | Can't prove what was installed |
| **Rush to tile** | Defects concealed permanently |

### Prevention

* Flood testing or equivalent verification before tile
* Photo documentation at each stage
* Inspector sign-off where required
* Written records of materials and methods

> **Red flag phrase:** "Inspection isn't necessary for this."

## Red Flags Homeowners Can Spot

### Warning Phrases

| What You Hear | What It May Mean |
|---------------|------------------|
| "We'll fix it with tile." | Substrate problems being ignored |
| "That's how we've always done it." | Outdated methods, resistance to standards |
| "Inspection isn't necessary for this." | Avoiding accountability |
| "Curbless means fewer rules." | Misunderstanding code requirements |
| "We don't need a permit for this." | Potential liability issue |
| "Trust me, I've done this a hundred times." | May not follow documented standards |

### Warning Actions

| What You See | What It May Mean |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Waterproofing covered immediately** | No verification performed |
| **No photos being taken** | No documentation trail |
| **Drain installed without discussion** | System may be incompatible |
| **"We'll figure out the bench later"** | Planning failures ahead |
| **Rush to get to tile** | Corners being cut on prep |

---

## What Quality Looks Like Instead

### Before Work Begins

* Decisions made before demolition
* Scope documented in writing
* Permit requirements confirmed with AHJ
* System components matched and specified

### During the Build

* Systems explained clearly and consistently
* Inspections treated as checkpoints, not obstacles
* Photos taken at each stage
* Verification performed before covering work

### At Completion

* Flood test performed and documented
* Inspector approval received
* Photos and records provided to homeowner
* Certificate of Approval obtained

---

## Cost of Failures vs. Prevention

| Scenario | Typical Cost Range |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Proper planning and installation** | Included in project cost |
| **Flood test reveals leak (pre-tile)** | Hours of repair time |
| **Leak discovered after tile** | $5,000-$15,000 tear-out and rebuild |
| **Water damage to structure** | $15,000-$50,000+ remediation |
| **Mold remediation required** | $10,000-$30,000+ |

> Prevention costs are measured in hours. Failures are measured in thousands of dollars and months of disruption.

## Questions to Ask Your Contractor

Before signing a contract:

1. Which TCNA methods will you follow?
2. Is your waterproofing system ANSI A118.10 compliant?
3. Will a flood test be performed?
4. Will inspections be scheduled at required stages?
5. Can I have photos of each stage before work is covered?
6. What happens if an inspection doesn't pass?
