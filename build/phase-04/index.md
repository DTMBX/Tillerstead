## Water Containment vs. Accessibility

**Shower curbs** (thresholds) prevent water from escaping the shower. **Curbless showers** eliminate the barrier for accessibility—but require more careful slope planning.

Both can be code-compliant and waterproof when done correctly.

## Traditional Shower Curbs

### Minimum Height

**6 inches** is standard, but can vary by local code and door type.

- Too low → water escapes
- Too high → difficult to step over (especially for elderly or mobility-impaired)

### Construction Methods

**Pre-formed foam curbs:**
- Lightweight, easy to cut
- Waterproofing wraps over top

**Mortar bed curbs:**
- Built-in-place using metal lath + mortar
- Fully customizable height/width

**Curb-forming systems:**
- Plastic/metal forms filled with mortar
- Integrated with waterproofing membrane

### Critical Details

✅ **Waterproofing must wrap over the curb** (top and both sides)  
✅ **Tile overhang:** Front edge must be waterproofed and sloped to drain  
✅ **Corners:** Inside corners reinforced with fabric or pre-formed corners  
✅ **Height verification:** Measure from shower pan, not subfloor

## Curbless (Zero-Entry) Showers

### Code Requirements (NJ/IRC)

- **Bathroom floor must slope toward drain** (or install trench drain)
- **Waterproofing extends beyond shower area** (to prevent water migration)
- **Minimum 30" x 30" clear floor space** inside shower

### Structural Considerations

Curbless showers often require:
- **Recessed subfloor** (to accommodate slope + tile thickness)
- **Structural modification** (cutting joists, adding support)
- **Permit and inspection** (structural changes require approval)

### Drainage Strategies

**Linear drain:**
- Rectangular drain channel
- Allows single-plane slope
- Popular for curbless designs

**Center point drain:**
- Requires four-way slope
- More complex to build curbless

**Trench/channel drain:**
- Outside shower area
- Collects water from bathroom floor

### Waterproofing Requirements

Waterproofing must extend:
- **Entire shower area** (obviously)
- **At least 9" beyond curb line** (TCNA recommendation)
- **Full bathroom floor** (if using trench drain strategy)

## Hybrid Approach: Low-Profile Curbs

**2-3 inch curbs** provide:
- Easier step-over than 6" curbs
- Water containment (with proper slope + door seal)
- Less structural modification than full curbless

Not technically "curbless," but achieves similar accessibility goals with less risk.

## Common Failures

❌ **Curb too low** (water escapes)  
❌ **Waterproofing doesn't wrap over curb top**  
❌ **Curbless shower without adequate slope**  
❌ **No extended waterproofing beyond shower area**  
❌ **Structural modification without permit**
