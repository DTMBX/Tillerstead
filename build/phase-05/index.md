## Functional Features Done Right

Shower benches, fold-down seats, and recessed niches add convenience—but only if they're waterproofed correctly and built to last.

## Shower Benches

### Construction Methods

**Pre-formed foam benches:**
- Lightweight, pre-sloped
- Integrated with waterproofing system

**Mortar bed benches:**
- Custom-built using metal lath + mortar
- Fully customizable size/shape

**Framed benches:**
- Wood or metal framing + cement board
- Requires waterproofing and slope verification

### Critical Requirements

✅ **Top must slope toward drain** (minimum 1/4" per foot)  
- Prevents standing water and mildew

✅ **All sides must be waterproofed**  
- Top, front, sides, underneath (if not against wall)

✅ **Load-bearing capacity**  
- Must support 250+ lbs (standard adult weight)

✅ **Proper height**  
- 17-19" is standard seat height (accessible design)

### Common Mistakes

❌ Flat bench top (water pools)  
❌ Waterproofing only on top (sides leak)  
❌ Inadequate framing (bench sags or cracks)  
❌ Too low or too high (uncomfortable)

## Fold-Down Shower Seats

### When to Use

- **Accessibility requirements** (ADA compliance)
- **Space constraints** (folds up when not needed)
- **Retrofit installations** (easier than built-in bench)

### Installation Requirements

✅ **Blocking in wall framing** (to support weight)  
✅ **Waterproofing behind seat** (when folded up)  
✅ **Proper height** (17-19" from floor when deployed)  
✅ **Load rating** (verify manufacturer specs—usually 250-500 lbs)

### Types

**Wall-mounted:**
- Folds flat against wall
- Requires solid blocking

**L-shaped:**
- Provides back support
- Larger footprint when deployed

## Recessed Niches (Shower Shelves)

### The Golden Rules

1. **Bottom must slope toward shower** (1/4" per foot minimum)
2. **All 6 sides must be waterproofed** (back, top, bottom, 3 sides)
3. **No gaps** in waterproofing at transitions

### Construction Methods

**Pre-formed niches:**
- Ready-to-install units (Kerdi-Board-SN, Schluter, Wedi, etc.)
- Built-in slope and waterproofing flanges

**Site-built niches:**
- Cut into wall framing between studs
- Lined with cement board or foam board
- Fully waterproofed before tile

### Sizing Considerations

**Standard depth:** 3.5" (fits between 2x4 studs)  
**Width:** 12-16" (between stud bays)  
**Height:** 12-18" (single shelf)

**Pro tip:** Multiple smaller niches work better than one large niche.

### Location

**Ideal placement:**
- Within reach of shower user (not too high)
- Not in direct water spray (if possible)
- Between studs (avoids structural cuts)

**Avoid:**
- Exterior walls (moisture/insulation issues)
- Load-bearing walls (without engineering approval)

### Waterproofing Sequence

1. Frame or install pre-formed niche
2. Apply waterproofing to shower walls
3. Integrate niche waterproofing with wall membrane
4. Overlap seams by 2" minimum
5. Verify no gaps or voids
6. Photograph before tiling

## Common Failures

❌ **Flat niche bottom** (water sits, mildew grows)  
❌ **Incomplete waterproofing** (back/sides not sealed)  
❌ **Gap at niche-to-wall transition** (water intrusion path)  
❌ **Niche too deep** (cut through insulation/exterior sheathing)  
❌ **Bench without slope** (standing water, deterioration)
