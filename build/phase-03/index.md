## The Most Critical Phase

Tile is decorative. **Waterproofing is structural.** A beautiful tile job over inadequate waterproofing will fail—every time.

## ANSI A118.10 Compliance

All shower waterproofing systems must meet **ANSI A118.10** standards for bonded waterproof membranes in wet areas.

### What This Standard Requires

- **Bonded to substrate** (not isolated)
- **Continuous protection** at all seams, corners, penetrations
- **Load-bearing** (can support tile assembly)
- **Hydrostatic pressure resistance**

## Types of Waterproofing Systems

### Sheet Membranes (Kerdi, RedGard Board, etc.)

Pre-fabricated sheets applied with thin-set mortar or adhesive.

**Pros:**
- Predictable thickness
- Easy to verify coverage
- Fast installation

**Cons:**
- Requires precise cuts at drains/corners
- Seams must be carefully detailed

### Liquid-Applied Membranes (RedGard, AquaDefense, Hydroban)

Brush/roll-on waterproofing, similar to thick paint.

**Pros:**
- Seamless coverage
- Easy to detail penetrations
- No special tools required

**Cons:**
- Thickness variations (multiple coats required)
- Dry time between coats
- Harder to verify coverage visually

### Hybrid Systems

Combination of sheet + liquid (e.g., sheet on pan, liquid on walls).

## Critical Details

### Corners (Inside & Outside)

Most common failure point. Must be reinforced with:
- Pre-formed corners, OR
- Fabric reinforcement strips embedded in membrane

### Drains

Drain assembly must integrate with waterproofing membrane:
- Bonding flanges
- Clamping rings
- Weep holes (for mortar bed systems)

### Niches

Recessed shelves require:
- Back-sloped bottom (so water drains out)
- Fully wrapped waterproofing (all 6 sides)
- Proper bonding to wall membrane

### Penetrations (Valves, Mix

ers, Body Sprays)

Seal around all penetrations using:
- Pre-formed gaskets
- Liquid membrane collars
- Overlap with wall membrane

## Flood Testing

For **mortar bed** shower pans: flood testing is required per TCNA.

**How:**
1. Plug drain
2. Fill pan with water (2" deep)
3. Mark water level
4. Wait 24-48 hours
5. Verify no drop in level

For **bonded membrane** systems over solid substrate: flood testing may not be required, but is recommended.

## Documentation

✅ Photograph waterproofing before tile installation  
✅ Record product names, batch numbers  
✅ Save manufacturer spec sheets  
✅ Document flood test results (if performed)

This documentation protects you and your contractor.
