# Flood Testing & Pre-Tile Verification

## Step 7 of the Construction Order — Proving the System Before It's Hidden

Flood testing is the **last opportunity to verify waterproofing performance** before tile and grout permanently conceal the system. This step is about confirmation—not correction.

This guide references [**IAPMO/ANSI Z124.6**](https://www.iapmo.org/) and industry-accepted flood testing protocols. In New Jersey, flood testing may be **required, requested, or strongly recommended** depending on the municipality and the waterproofing method used.

## The Core Principle

> **If waterproofing cannot hold water temporarily, it cannot manage water long-term.**

Flood testing evaluates the integrity of the waterproofing system—not the tile, grout, or drain finish.

---

## What Flood Testing Is

Flood testing is a controlled process where:

* The drain is temporarily sealed below the waterproofing connection
* The shower base is filled with water
* The water level is monitored for loss over a defined period

### What Flood Testing Confirms

| Verification | What It Proves |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Waterproofing continuity** | No gaps, holes, or unsealed penetrations |
| **Drain integration** | Membrane properly bonded or clamped to drain |
| **Corner treatment** | Inside and outside corners are sealed |
| **Curb integrity** | Waterproofing properly wraps curb (if applicable) |

---

## What Flood Testing Is *Not*

Flood testing is **not**:

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| A test of tile or grout | Tile is installed *after* flood testing |
| A substitute for proper slope | Water must reach the drain by design |
| A repair method | Identifies problems, doesn't fix them |
| A guarantee against future abuse | Tests current installation only |

Flood testing verifies installation—not design shortcuts.

---

## When Flood Testing Occurs

### Correct Timing

Flood testing is performed:

* **After waterproofing is complete and cured**
* **After all penetrations are sealed**
* **Before tile installation begins**

### Why Timing Matters

| Timing | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Before membrane cures** | Invalid test, may damage membrane |
| **After tile** | Cannot identify membrane defects |
| **After fixtures** | Cannot access waterproofing for repair |

---

## How to Conduct a Flood Test

### Step-by-Step Protocol

**1. Ensure Membrane is Cured**
* Follow manufacturer cure times (typically 24-72 hours)
* Liquid membranes must be fully dry
* Sheet membranes must have proper seam bonding

**2. Plug the Drain**
* Use an expandable test plug or mechanical seal
* Plug must seal **below** the waterproofing connection
* Do not rely on temporary tape or debris

**3. Fill the Shower Pan**
* Fill slowly to avoid disturbing membrane
* Fill to the top of the curb or threshold
* For curbless showers, fill to the lowest exit point

**4. Mark the Water Level**
* Use tape or marker to indicate starting level
* Photograph the marked level with timestamp

**5. Wait the Required Duration**
* **Minimum:** Sufficient time to observe stability (1-4 hours)
* **Common requirement:** 24 hours for formal testing
* **Verify locally:** Your municipality may have specific requirements

**6. Observe and Document**
* Check water level against mark
* Inspect below the shower for any leakage
* Document results with photos

**7. Release Water Slowly**
* Remove plug carefully
* Allow water to drain completely
* Inspect membrane for any damage

---

## Duration & Observation Requirements

Testing duration varies by:

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Local inspector requirements** | Some municipalities require 24+ hours |
| **Manufacturer recommendations** | System-specific guidance |
| **Project conditions** | Temperature, evaporation rate |

### What to Watch For

| Observation | Indicates |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Stable water level** | Waterproofing integrity confirmed |
| **Slow water loss** | Potential pinhole or seam issue |
| **Rapid water loss** | Major breach—requires investigation |
| **Water below shower** | Failure—must identify and repair |

---

## NJ Inspector Expectations

What inspectors may require or verify:

| Requirement | Varies By Municipality |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Witness the test** | Some require in-person observation |
| **Accept documentation** | Some accept photos and records |
| **Specific duration** | May specify minimum test time |
| **Pre-tile timing** | Always before tile installation |

### How to Confirm Local Requirements

1. **Contact your local Construction Office** before waterproofing
2. **Ask specifically:** "Do you require a witnessed flood test?"
3. **Document the answer** for your records
4. **Schedule the inspection** with adequate notice

> **Pro tip:** Even if your municipality doesn't require flood testing, a documented test protects you and demonstrates quality workmanship. We perform flood tests on all our shower installations.

## Documentation Best Practices

### What to Record

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Date and time started** | Proves duration |
| **Date and time ended** | Confirms test period |
| **Water level photos** | Visual evidence |
| **Below-shower inspection** | Confirms no leakage |
| **Plug type and location** | Shows proper procedure |
| **Inspector name/approval** | If witnessed |

### Photo Documentation

Take photos of:
1. Dry pan before filling
2. Plug installed in drain
3. Water level at start (with tape marker visible)
4. Water level at end (same angle)
5. Area below shower (basement ceiling, crawlspace)
6. Any issues found (if applicable)

---

## Common Flood Testing Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's a Problem | Prevention |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| **Testing before membrane cures** | Invalid results, potential damage | Follow manufacturer cure times |
| **Plugging above waterproofing** | Only tests partial system | Plug below membrane connection |
| **Insufficient duration** | May miss slow leaks | Test for recommended duration |
| **Not marking water level** | Can't measure loss accurately | Always mark starting level |
| **Testing flat or reversed slope** | Water won't indicate failure location | Verify slope before test |
| **Assuming passed means perfect** | Other issues may exist | Test is one verification step |

---

## What Happens If a Test Fails

If water loss or leakage is observed:

### Immediate Steps

1. **Stop** — Do not proceed with tile
2. **Drain** — Remove water carefully
3. **Dry** — Allow membrane to dry completely
4. **Investigate** — Locate the failure point
5. **Repair** — Fix per manufacturer instructions
6. **Re-test** — Verify repair before tile

### Common Failure Locations

| Location | Likely Cause |
|----------|--------------|
| **Drain connection** | Improper bonding or clamping |
| **Corners** | Inadequate reinforcement |
| **Curb base** | Membrane not properly wrapped |
| **Penetrations** | Unsealed pipes or controls |
| **Seams** | Insufficient overlap |

## Why Flood Testing Matters to Homeowners

### Protection Flood Testing Provides

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Confirms containment** | Water stays where it belongs |
| **Catches defects early** | Before tile conceals problems |
| **Protects framing** | Prevents hidden structural damage |
| **Documents quality** | Evidence of proper installation |
| **Reduces future cost** | Finding leaks now vs. after tile |

### The Cost of Skipping

| Scenario | Approximate Cost |
|----------|------------------|
| **Flood test reveals small leak** | Repair cost before tile |
| **Leak discovered after tile** | Tear out and rebuild: $5,000-$15,000+ |
| **Leak causes structural damage** | Major remediation: $15,000-$50,000+ |

> Flood testing is verification—not a sales feature. It's one of the most cost-effective steps in the entire build.

## Questions Homeowners Should Ask

Before waterproofing is complete:

* Will you perform a flood test?
* Does our municipality require a witnessed test?
* How long will the test last?
* Will you provide documentation and photos?
* What happens if the test fails?
* Is flood testing included in the contract?
