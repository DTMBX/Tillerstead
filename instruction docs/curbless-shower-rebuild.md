# Curbless Shower Rebuild Reference

This document provides a field-ready sequence for constructing a true curbless (zero-threshold) shower and supporting planning equations suitable for estimator or calculator tools. Calculations are planning aids only; verify all measurements and code requirements on site.

## Definitions

- **True curbless / zero-threshold:** A shower floor that maintains a continuous slope (target 1/4 in. per ft.) from the dry-side entry to the drain while keeping the finished bathroom floor flush at the transition, with waterproofing extending under the entire sloped plane.
- **Recessed-entry / barrier-reduced:** A shower area that lowers the structural or mortar build-up near the entry to soften the transition but still requires a minor bevel or trim piece; used when full flushness cannot be achieved without structural modification.

## Step-by-step build sequence

1. **Selective demolition and substrate exposure**  
   Remove finishes down to sound framing or concrete, extending past the planned wet area so adjoining flooring can be feathered.
2. **Framing or recess strategy (when required)**  
   Notch or lower joists only when structurally approved, or install engineered recess systems to gain depth without compromising load paths; reinforce sistered members as specified.
3. **Subfloor prep and flatness verification**  
   Check the exposed deck with straightedges; correct deflection, delamination, or fastener withdrawal before introducing slope.
4. **Slope planning and calculations**  
   Confirm drain location, measure the longest run to the entry, and document required drop using the equations below; mark perimeter control lines.
5. **Mortar-bed floating and shaping**  
   Place bonded or unbonded deck mud per substrate requirements, keeping minimum thickness at the drain per manufacturer instructions and striking planes to the marked elevations.
6. **Waterproofing installation (continuous plane)**  
   Extend sheet or liquid membrane beneath the entire sloped area and at least 12 in. into the dry zone; overlap seams per system specs and embed reinforcing at all changes of plane.
7. **Drain integration and membrane termination**  
   Match the drain body to the membrane type (e.g., bonding flange with sheet membrane); clamp, bond, or weld per system requirements and protect weep pathways.
8. **Flood testing and documentation**  
   Plug the drain, fill to the highest perimeter point, record start/stop times, waterline marks, and photo evidence; maintain a minimum 24-hour dwell or local requirement (verify locally).
9. **Tile installation and movement accommodation**  
   Use thinset compatible with the membrane, maintain trowel orientation downhill, honor soft joints at perimeters, and coordinate transitions to adjacent flooring.
10. **Final inspection and quality verification**  
    Confirm slope with digital level readings, verify flush entry, document drain operation, and log waterproofing lot numbers or approvals for closeout.

## Planning equations

- **Required drop (inches):** `drop_in = distance_to_drain_ft × slope_rate_in_per_ft`
- **Perimeter elevation (inches):** `perimeter_height_in = drain_flange_height_in + drop_in`
- **Average mortar-bed thickness (inches):** `avg_thickness_in = (drain_thickness_in + perimeter_thickness_in) ÷ 2`

**Variables**

- `distance_to_drain_ft`: longest run from entry to drain center (ft)
- `slope_rate_in_per_ft`: commonly 0.25 in./ft.; adjust only when permitted by design professional
- `drain_flange_height_in`: finished height at drain connection (including membrane build)
- `perimeter_thickness_in`: planned mortar height at the farthest point

> Calculators must flag that outputs are preliminary; adjust for framing deflection, tile thickness, and manufacturer minimums before installation.

### Distance-to-drop reference (1/4 in. per ft.)

| Distance to drain (ft) | Required drop (in.) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1                      | 0.25                |
| 2                      | 0.50                |
| 3                      | 0.75                |
| 4                      | 1.00                |
| 5                      | 1.25                |

## Common failure conditions

- Flat floors where slope was assumed but never verified with measurements or flood tests.
- Sudden plane changes or improvised ramps at entries that trap water or create trip hazards.
- Interrupted or patchworked waterproofing that leaves joints, seams, or penetrations unsealed.
- Mixing drains and membranes that are not designed to work together, resulting in delamination or clogged weep channels.

Always verify structural allowances, plumbing approvals, and inspection criteria with the local authority before work proceeds.
