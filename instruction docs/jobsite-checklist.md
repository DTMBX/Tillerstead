# Jobsite Checklist – True Curbless Shower

Use this checklist alongside daily reports. Verify all measurements on site and record deviations before proceeding.

## Pre-slope preparation

- [ ] Demolition extends past wet area and substrate is cleaned of adhesives or contaminants.
- [ ] Framing or slab recess strategy reviewed with structural notes; joists or concrete recesses reinforced as specified.
- [ ] Subfloor or slab flatness verified with 6 ft. straightedge; defects corrected and fasteners re-secured.

## Slope planning and mortar work

- [ ] Longest distance to drain measured and required drop calculated/documented.
- [ ] Perimeter elevation control lines snapped or laser-marked.
- [ ] Mortar bed placed to required thickness at drain and perimeter; screeds follow marked slope.

## Waterproofing and drain integration

- [ ] Membrane (sheet or liquid) installed as one continuous plane and lapped into the dry zone.
- [ ] Changes of plane reinforced with manufacturer-provided corners or fabric.
- [ ] Drain body matches membrane system; bonding or clamping interface inspected before concealment.

## Testing and finishes

- [ ] Flood test performed (minimum duration per local authority); start/stop times logged.
- [ ] Any leaks corrected and re-tested prior to tile installation.
- [ ] Tile set with compatible thinset; movement joints at perimeters and transitions maintained.
- [ ] Final inspection completed: slope readings recorded, drain cleared, photos filed.
