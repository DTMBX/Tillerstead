# Inspection and Risk Notes

Use this reference to coordinate inspections, reduce liability, and document performance milestones for true curbless showers. Requirements vary by jurisdiction—verify locally before scheduling inspections or sign-offs.

## Slope verification concepts

- Record the designed slope rate (typically 1/4 in. per ft.) and measure the finished mortar bed with a digital level or laser before waterproofing.
- Document the longest run, required drop, and actual readings at a minimum of four quadrants.
- Include photos of measurement devices in place to confirm that the zero-threshold entry remains flush while maintaining the downhill plane.

## Drain performance considerations

- Confirm the drain body and strainer are free of debris before flood testing; photograph exposed weep holes or troughs.
- Note the trap primer or venting method if required locally, and test for adequate flow by briefly removing the test plug and observing draw-down.
- Keep manufacturer data sheets on site to show the drain is listed for the intended membrane type and flow rating.

## Waterproofing continuity risks

- Inspect transitions between horizontal and vertical planes for reinforced seams; flag any field-fabricated penetrations for patching before tile work.
- Avoid mixing primers, sealants, or seam tapes from different systems without written approval.
- Track cure times and environmental conditions in daily reports so inspectors can verify compliance with manufacturer requirements.

## Water migration at zero-threshold entries

- Use straightedges to confirm the dry-side floor back-slopes away from the shower by at least 1/16 in. per ft., or maintain perfectly flat transitions protected by the continuous waterproof membrane.
- Provide drainage paths or concealed pans under door tracks when glass is specified; sealant alone is not a water stop.
- Note any nearby electrical or wood finishes that could be affected by incidental splash and document the protection method.

## Flood-test documentation value

- Maintain a flood-test log (see template) capturing fill height, start/stop times, ambient conditions, and inspector sign-offs when required.
- Mark the waterline with tape or pencil at multiple walls so any drop is visible; photograph before and after draining.
- Retain copies of test results and related photos with the project closeout packet to defend against future moisture claims.

## Photo documentation checklist

1. Exposed framing or slab after demolition, showing recess modifications.
2. Mortar bed screeds and control lines prior to troweling.
3. Waterproofing coverage at the entry, drain flange, and each corner.
4. Flood test setup with gauge or tape measure confirming water depth.
5. Post-test images of the dry surface and drain assembly prior to tile.
6. Final finished floor showing flush transition and installed fixtures.

Label all photos with date, location, and reference number tied to daily reports or inspection logs.
