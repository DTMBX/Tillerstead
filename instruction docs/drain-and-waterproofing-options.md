# Drain and Waterproofing Options

This guide outlines drain assemblies and waterproofing systems commonly used for true curbless showers. Select components as an integrated system and verify manufacturer instructions along with local plumbing approvals.

## Drain types

### Bonding-flange point drains

- Integrated flange accepts sheet or liquid membranes without clamping hardware.
- Ideal for single-plane mortar beds because the membrane can be bonded directly and carried continuously to the entry.
- Requires precise elevation control so tile thickness finishes flush with the grate frame.

### Clamping-ring drains

- Legacy two- or three-piece bodies that mechanically clamp the membrane between rings.
- Work well with traditionally floated pans where the primary waterproof layer sits below a setting bed; maintain clean weep paths.
- Ensure the membrane type is rated for mechanical compression and protect bolt penetrations with sealant compatible with the system.

### Linear drains (contextual use)

- Used when design calls for a single-direction slope or when the drain must sit near the entry; confirm recessed framing can handle the elongated body.
- Pay attention to outlet placement, strainer maintenance access, and the need for higher flow rates from multiple shower heads.
- Coordinate grate width and finish with adjacent floor coverings to maintain the zero-threshold transition.

## Waterproofing approaches

### Sheet membranes

- Provide uniform thickness and predictable perm ratings; seams are overlapped or seamed using manufacturer banding.
- Pair naturally with bonding-flange drains but can also interface with clamping drains using preformed collars.
- Require careful inside/outside corner treatment and diligent substrate prep to avoid telegraphing defects.

### Liquid-applied membranes

- Useful for complex geometries and for tying into existing substrates; apply in alternating directions to reach specified mil thickness.
- Need curing verification before flood testing; record batch numbers and wet-film thickness readings.
- Use reinforcing fabric at plane changes, penetrations, and along the zero-threshold entry to handle foot traffic stresses.

## Compatibility considerations

- **Thinset categories:** Match mortar type (ANSI A118 series) to both the membrane and tile; rapid-setting mortars may be restricted over some liquid membranes.
- **Reinforcement at changes of plane:** Embed fabric or preformed corners where the slope meets walls, benches, or glass channels.
- **Single-system consistency:** Avoid mixing primers, membranes, and drains from unrelated manufacturers unless a written approval or tested assembly is provided.
- **Thermal and structural movement:** Include soft joints or movement accommodation profiles at perimeters and transitions.

## Practical selection criteria

- **Geometry:** Choose drains and membranes that suit the room layout, joist spacing, and transition requirements without introducing abrupt plane changes.
- **Maintenance expectations:** Provide clean-out access, removable grates, and inspectable weep channels to support long-term service.
- **Sequencing and access:** Confirm that slab recesses, blocking, and plumbing rough-ins are complete before membranes arrive on site; schedule flood testing before enclosure glass or finishes limit visibility.
- **Verify locally:** Local code officials may require listed drains, specific test durations, or inspector presence during flood tests; document approvals in the project file.
