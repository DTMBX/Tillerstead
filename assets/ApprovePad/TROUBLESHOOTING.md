# Troubleshooting

## Nothing happens when I click buttons

- Make sure a target window exists (terminal/editor) and you clicked into it.
- If the target app is running as Administrator, run Approve Pad as Administrator.

## It types into the wrong window

- Use Lock Target (Ctrl+Alt+L) to freeze the destination.
- Keep the pad on a second monitor or snap it to the side.

## "No" needs two clicks

- This is intentional protection against accidental rejects.
