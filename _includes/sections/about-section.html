      <h2 id="details-heading">Why Details Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Tile problems usually don’t start at the surface. They start underneath: poor substrate prep, inadequate flatness, skipped movement accommodation, or a wet area that was never built as a true waterproofing assembly. That’s why our work begins with verification—then we build the system to the requirements of the selected method and materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don’t treat mortars and membranes as interchangeable. Material selection follows published specifications (including applicable ANSI classifications and manufacturer data sheets), and movement accommodation is planned and installed where required (including TCNA EJ171 guidance for movement joints).
      </p>
      <p>
        In showers and wet areas, waterproofing is constructed as a complete assembly—including transitions, penetrations, and drain integration—then verified before tile. Where testing is required or method-appropriate, we perform it and document it.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The goal is simple: fewer surprises, fewer callbacks, and a bathroom you don’t have to think about.

      <h2 id="process-heading">How We Work</h2>
      <p>
        Most homeowners don’t want to manage trades—they want a clear plan and a clean result. Here’s what you can expect:
      </p>
      <ul class="ts-list">
        <li><strong>Written scope &amp; contract:</strong> scope, materials, schedule approach, payment terms, and warranty—before work begins.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification before finishes:</strong> substrate readiness, wet-area system steps, and pre-tile checks are confirmed before covering work.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation you can keep:</strong> key-phase photos compiled for owner records and future maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear communication:</strong> timely updates, and direct answers—especially when decisions affect cost or timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Change orders in writing:</strong> scope or price changes are approved before we proceed—no surprise invoices.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="highlight-box" role="note">
        <strong>What this prevents:</strong> vague quotes, “we’ll figure it out later,” and expensive corrections after tile is installed.

      <h2 id="fit-heading">Who We’re a Good Fit For</h2>
      <p>
        We're best for NJ homeowners who value durability and clear expectations—especially in showers, bathrooms, and other wet areas.
      </p>
      <ul class="ts-list">
        <li><strong>Good fit:</strong> you want the build done right, documented, and explained in plain language.</li>
        <li><strong>Good fit:</strong> you care about prep, waterproofing, and long-term performance—not just fast completion.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a fit:</strong> you’re shopping strictly for the lowest number and don’t want verification steps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        If you’re not sure, that’s fine—our estimate process is designed to clarify scope and options early.
