        <h3>Walk-through &amp; Assessment</h3>
        <p>Start with a free on-site consultation to review your goals, budget, and property conditions. I identify any underlying issues so your project is built on solid information from day one.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="ts-process__step">
        <h3>Written Scope &amp; Approval</h3>
        <p>Receive a detailed written scope covering materials, timelines, waterproofing assemblies, and clear change-order terms. You always know what’s included, when it’s coming, and why.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="ts-process__step">
        <h3>Execution &amp; Closeout</h3>
        <p>Work proceeds with daily photo updates and on-site cleanliness. At completion, you get a final checklist and can opt into a maintenance plan to keep everything performing and looking its best.</p>
