# Internal Linking Strategy: Demonstrating Technical Competence

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines a strategic approach to integrating blog posts into service pages and content areas. The goal is to **naturally demonstrate TCNA compliance, technical expertise, and standards-based work**—without over-linking or appearing spammy.

**Philosophy**: Links should serve the reader by providing deeper technical context, not the website. Each link earns its place by clarifying or enriching the surrounding content.

## 🎯 Implementation Guidelines

### DO ✅

- ✅ Link to blog posts only when they **directly support** the surrounding content
- ✅ Use **descriptive anchor text** that hints at the link destination
- ✅ Spread links across **different sections and pages** (don't cluster)
- ✅ Link once per concept (don't repeat the same post multiple times on one page)
- ✅ Choose blog posts that **demonstrate specific TCNA knowledge**
- ✅ Test links before publishing to ensure they work

### DON'T ❌

- ❌ Force links into sentences where they feel awkward
- ❌ Use generic anchor text like "click here" or "learn more"
- ❌ Link multiple times to the same blog post on the same page
- ❌ Add links to pages that don't naturally support them (about, contact, pricing)
- ❌ Use links as a replacement for clear, complete content on the page
- ❌ Over-link (max 3-4 per page, 1-2 per section)

## 🔍 Link Quality Checklist

Before adding each link:

- [ ] Does this link **directly answer** a question in the surrounding text?
- [ ] Would a reader **benefit** from this context, or does it feel promotional?
- [ ] Is the anchor text **descriptive** (not "click here" or "learn more")?
- [ ] Have I already **linked to this post** on this page?
- [ ] Does the blog post **add technical depth**, not just repeat the page?
- [ ] Is the blog post **relevant to the page topic** (not off-topic)?
- [ ] Are there **fewer than 4 links** on this page total?

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### To Track

- Click-through rate on internal links (should be 5-15% depending on page)
- Pages-per-session (should increase slightly)
- Blog post traffic from internal links (track referrers)
- Bounce rate on service pages (should decrease slightly)

### Goals
