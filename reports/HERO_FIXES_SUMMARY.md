# Homepage Hero Fixes Summary

**Date:** December 27, 2025  
**Device:** iPhone 16 Pro Max  
**Issue:** Hero text redundancy and layout problems

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed "| Tillerstead LLC" from Main Heading

**Before:**

```
TCNA-Compliant Tile, Waterproofing & Remodeling | Tillerstead LLC
```

**After:**

```
TCNA-Compliant Tile, Waterproofing & Remodeling
```

**Why:** The company name was redundant since the logo already identifies the brand. Cleaner heading without the pipe separator.

---

### 2. ✅ Removed "Licensed" from New Jersey HIC Badge Text

**Before:**

```
New Jersey licensed HIC #13VH10808800
```

**After:**

```
New Jersey HIC #13VH10808800
```

**Why:** More concise. The HIC number itself implies licensing. Reduces text clutter on mobile.

---

### 3. ✅ Changed Logo from Stacked to Mark-Only

**Before:**

- Used `logo-stacked` (full vertical logo with text)
- Same as header logo (redundant)

**After:**

- Uses `logo-mark` (tile pattern only, no text)
- Different from header, creates visual hierarchy
- More compact for mobile display

**Why:**

- Reduces visual repetition
- Tile mark is iconic and recognizable
- Better suited for hero section (logo in header already has text)
- More mobile-friendly (less vertical space)

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `index.html` (Homepage)

```diff
- title: TCNA-Compliant Tile, Waterproofing & Remodeling | Tillerstead LLC
+ title: TCNA-Compliant Tile, Waterproofing & Remodeling
```

### 2. `_includes/unified-hero-home.html`

**Logo change:**

```diff
- symbol="logo-stacked"
+ symbol="logo-mark"
```

**License text:**

```diff
- <strong>New Jersey licensed HIC #13VH10808800</strong>
+ <strong>New Jersey HIC #13VH10808800</strong>
```

---

## Visual Improvements

### Mobile Display (iPhone 16 Pro Max)

**Before Issues:**

- Long heading with pipe separator was wordy
- "Licensed" redundantly emphasized
- Stacked logo same as header (no differentiation)
- Too much vertical space consumed

**After Improvements:**

- ✅ Clean, concise heading
- ✅ Streamlined license badge
- ✅ Distinct hero logo (mark vs full logo)
- ✅ Better vertical space utilization
- ✅ Improved visual hierarchy

---

## Logo Variants Available

From `_includes/logo-sprite-inline.html`:

1. **`logo-mark`** - Tile pattern only (5 squares) ✅ **NOW USED IN HERO**
2. **`logo-mark-mono`** - Monochrome tile pattern
3. **`logo-stacked`** - Full vertical logo with text
4. **`logo-horizontal`** - Full horizontal logo
5. **`logo-horizontal-mono`** - Monochrome horizontal

**Decision:** Use `logo-mark` in hero because:

- Unique to hero section
- Compact and iconic
- Complements (doesn't duplicate) header logo
- Better mobile UX

```

### Benefits

- Cleaner visual flow
- Less text to read on small screens
- Logo variety creates interest
- Professional, uncluttered appearance

---

## SEO Impact

### Page Title

- **Old:** `TCNA-Compliant Tile, Waterproofing & Remodeling | Tillerstead LLC`
- **New:** `TCNA-Compliant Tile, Waterproofing & Remodeling`

**Note:** The `<title>` tag in `<head>` still contains the full company name for SEO. Only the H1/hero heading was simplified for UX.

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] View homepage on iPhone 16 Pro Max
- [ ] Verify logo displays as tile mark (not stacked)
- [ ] Confirm heading has no pipe or company name
- [ ] Check license badge says "New Jersey HIC" not "New Jersey licensed HIC"
- [ ] Ensure logo is different from header logo
- [ ] Test on various mobile devices (375px - 430px width)
- [ ] Verify desktop still looks good

## Additional Recommendations

### Future Mobile Hero Improvements (Optional)

1. **Reduce tagline length** on mobile
   - Current: "ANSI A108-compliant installation, ANSI A108.10 waterproofing, L/360 deflection verified—engineered, not estimated."
   - Consider shorter mobile version or breakpoint-specific content

2. **Stack trust indicators** vertically on narrow screens
   - Currently uses middot separators
   - Could benefit from vertical list on <480px

3. **Optimize button sizing** for touch
   - Ensure minimum 44px height on mobile
   - Add more spacing between buttons

4. **Consider hero image visibility**
   - May want to hide/fade hero image on smallest screens
   - Or use different aspect ratio image for mobile
